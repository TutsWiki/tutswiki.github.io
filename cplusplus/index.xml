Stroustrup’s C with Classes became C++ in 1983, the ‘++’ denoting the Increment Operator in C. The programming language can run on a number of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and numerous versions of UNIX.</description></item><item><title>Multithreading in C++</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/cplusplus/multithreading/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/cplusplus/multithreading/</guid><description>What is multithreading Multithreading enables us to do parallel computing efficiently by creating multiple threads of a single process. It is used for maximum utilization of the central processing unit by concurrently executing multiple parts of a program. These parts of the program are threads.
A process can be taken as an instance of a program that is being executed by one or more threads. When a program starts, it is loaded with an address space in the main memory from the hard disk.</description></item></channel></rss>
