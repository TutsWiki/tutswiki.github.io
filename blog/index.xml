As vast as the study of these fields are, they share a common functionality and performance unit known as Machine Learning. Machine Learning (ML)is a way of making computers act without being explicitly programmed where the system itself analyses the data provided and formulates a decision.
Software Developers and Data Scientists unlock potential for customers to do more than they otherwise could in a timely manner by building Application Programming Interface (APIs) for Machine Learning.</description></item><item><title>SDKMan - Installing Multiple Versions of Java in Same Machine</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/sdkman-installing-multiple-versions-java-same-machine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/sdkman-installing-multiple-versions-java-same-machine/</guid><description>In today&amp;rsquo;s world technology is evolving at a very high pace, everyday something new comes in the market.

Despite having all team members on board, the low productivity rate has to be explained by the Project Manager, who couldn&amp;rsquo;t plan the right course of actions or overlooked the breakdown in communications.
As simple and self-explanatory the term Project Manager sounds, his/her duty involves lots of multi-tasking and diversified knowledge in numerous areas.</description></item><item><title>How to setup and access QuestDB using Python</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/setup-access-questdb-python-notebook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/setup-access-questdb-python-notebook/</guid><description>What is QuestDB?

Anything from modelling the environment, to a lottery machine, to determining the value of loot in a chest in an RPG, will require random number generation. At first it may seem strange that computers, which are capable of producing massive amounts of digits in a short time, would not be able to produce random numbers. The difficulty is that the computers we use, are constructed specifically to follow logical steps deterministically, so to generate numbers that are truly random from a system like our computers is virtually impossible.</description></item><item><title>How to convert a Python script to module</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/convert-python-script-to-module/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/convert-python-script-to-module/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s common to create small scripts which we want to combine into a larger script. We don&amp;rsquo;t want to copy and paste the code. We want to leave the working code in one file and use it in multiple places. Often we want to combine elements from multiple files to create more sophisticated scripts.
The problem we have is that when we import a script it actually starts running. This is generally not what we expect when we import a script so that we can reuse it.</description></item><item><title>Grunt Tutorial with Live Example</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/grunt-tutorial-example/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/grunt-tutorial-example/</guid><description>So, what is this thing called Grunt and how can it help you?

Both the first and second are a peculiar way of documenting the code and help to limit (decouple) the interaction of individual abstractions in the program (classes).
Python is a very flexible language. One facet of this flexibility is the possibilities provided by metaprogramming. And although abstract classes and interfaces are not represented in the core of the language, the former were implemented in the standard abc module, and the latter in the Zope project (the zope.</description></item><item><title>How Deep Learning Helped Reducing Variability in Cardiovascular Imaging</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/deep-learning-cardiovascular-imaging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/deep-learning-cardiovascular-imaging/</guid><description>Bay Labs, a San Francisco-based medical technology company which focuses on using artificial intelligence to improve cardiovascular imaging, has released a new software EchoMD AutoEF.
