      <title>Environment Passing in Clojure</title>

      <description>Clojure’s vars provide a nice mechanism for managing dynamically bound state, but you need to be careful with vars when moving computations across thread boundaries. For example, suppose we implement the following timeout function:
(import &amp;#39;(java.util.concurrent Future TimeUnit)) (defn timeout1 [millis op] (.get (future-call op) millis TimeUnit/MILLISECONDS)) The function timeout1 sends the operation op to be computed in a separate, timeout-bound thread. If the operation completes within millis milliseconds, timeout1 returns the result of that operation, otherwise it throws an exception:</description>

      <description>Getting permission errors when installing a module?
Are &amp;lsquo;sudo: node: command not found&amp;rsquo; errors taking away your precious sleeping hours?
How to fix? You have to remove any trace of node on your system, and reinstall it. It will soothe your pain:
echo &amp;#39;export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc . ~/.bashrc mkdir ~/local &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ~/node-latest-install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ~/node-latest-install curl http://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1 ./configure --prefix=~/local &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh rm -rf ~/node-latest-install You are one/two steps/commands away from success.</description>

      <description>If a function has type A → B, and another function has type B → C, then we can &amp;ldquo;compose&amp;rdquo; them into a new function of type A → C.
  Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about functions that can return multiple values. We can model these as functions of type A → List&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;. There is a natural way to &amp;ldquo;compose&amp;rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → List&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;, and another function has type B → List&amp;lt;C&amp;gt;, then we can &amp;ldquo;compose&amp;rdquo; them into a new function of type A → List&amp;lt;C&amp;gt;.</description>

      <title>A Deeper Look at Ruby&#39;s Enumerable</title>

      <description>Have you ever needed to load a VERY large file in ruby? No I don’t mean your 500 line rails model. I mean a several gig binary or text file.
Try it. Watch your machine become unresponsive. Cry a little inside. Then reach for enumerable.
Ruby’s Enumerable module gives you a way of iterating over collections in a lazy manner, loading only what you need, when you need it. But it gives us so much more than that.</description>

      <title>A REST API in Clojure</title>

      <description>Clojure is one of the most interesting new languages targeting the JVM. Initially only the JVM, in the meantime it is also available for JavaScript. Essentially, you can write Clojure and either execute it as Java program or JavaScript program, of course each flavor has its unique features as well.
Clojure is a Lisp, thus the syntax may be foreign, but it is really, really easy since there are very few syntactic variations.</description>

      <title>Abstract classes and interfaces in Python</title>

      <description>Abstract base classes and interfaces are entities that are similar in purpose and meaning. Both the first and second are a peculiar way of documenting the code and help to limit (decouple) the interaction of individual abstractions in the program (classes).
Python is a very flexible language. One facet of this flexibility is the possibilities provided by metaprogramming. And although abstract classes and interfaces are not represented in the core of the language, the former were implemented in the standard abc module, and the latter in the Zope project (the zope.</description>

      <title>How Deep Learning Helped Reducing Variability in Cardiovascular Imaging</title>
      <link>http://tutswiki.com/deep-learning-cardiovascular-imaging/</link>

      <description>Bay Labs, a San Francisco-based medical technology company which focuses on using artificial intelligence to improve cardiovascular imaging, has released a new software EchoMD AutoEF. It is being claimed that this software will help to reduce the variability in cardiovascular imaging.
The software uses deep learning techniques to accurately calculate the left ventricular ejection fraction.
What is Ejection Fraction? During each pumping cycle of our heart, it contracts and relaxes. When it contracts it passes the blood to ventricles.</description>

      <title>Google Engineers Boycott Against Security Tool for Military</title>

      <description>On the one hand this is good as it shows that employees get ample space to air grievances, but on the other hand, the shareholders will get angry as it hampers Google&amp;rsquo;s ability to compete. In order to get government contracts especially those which involves sensitive data and military require some certifications, which Google&amp;rsquo;s competitors like Microsoft and Amazon have but Google doesn&amp;rsquo;t. This air-gap feature was supposed to help Google with that but it seems it&amp;rsquo;ll be abandoned.</description>

      <description>A couple of years ago Microsoft was anti-open-source.
 &amp;ldquo;Open source is an intellectual-property destroyer. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.&amp;rdquo; - Jim Allchin (Former Windows chief), 2001
  &amp;ldquo;Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.&amp;rdquo; - Steve Ballmer (Former CEO)
 However, in recent years Microsoft has tried hard to catch up with the open-source world.</description>

      <title>Difference between append and extend in Python</title>
      <link>http://tutswiki.com/append-vs-extend-python/</link>

      <guid>http://tutswiki.com/append-vs-extend-python/</guid>
      <description>append and extend are list methods in Python which can be used to combine multiple lists. But what is the difference between them? When should you use one over another, let&amp;rsquo;s find out.
The official documentation describes them as:
  list.append(x): Add an item to the end of the list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].
  list.extend(L): Extend the list by appending all the items in the given list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = L.</description>

      <title>How to print on same line with print in Python</title>
      <link>http://tutswiki.com/print-same-line-python/</link>

      <guid>http://tutswiki.com/print-same-line-python/</guid>
      <description>In Python, when you use the print function, it prints a new line at the end.
For example:
print &amp;#34;This is some line.&amp;#34; print &amp;#34;This is another line.&amp;#34; Output:
This is some line. This is another line. What if you want to avoid the newline and want to print both statements on same line? Well, there are 2 possible solutions.
Add comma at the end of print print &amp;#34;This is some line.</description>

      <title>Writing and Reading config files in Python</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you must be aware about the importance of configuration files. Config files help creating the initial settings for any project, they help avoiding the hardcoded data.
Imagine if you migrate your server to a new host and suddenly your application stops working, now you have to go through your code and search/replace IP address of host at all the places. Config file comes to the rescue in such situation.</description>

      <title>How to run a Python module as script?</title>

      <description>Suppose you have a module named mymath.py, which has a couple of functions. You can import this module in your script and call these functions.
def int_sum(a, b): print a+b def some_other_function(): pass But, what if you want to run the module itself as a script?
Well, if you want to use a Python module as script then you just have to use the conditional for __name__.
def int_sum(a, b): print a+b if __name__ == &amp;#34;__main__&amp;#34;: import sys int_sum(int(sys.</description>

      <description>If you are new to Python then you may have noticed if __name__ == &amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot; line in some python codes.
You may be wondering:
 What does that mean? What purpose does it serve? I don&amp;rsquo;t see it in all Python codes, so when should I use it exactly? Can you give me some examples?  Let me try to explain the above to you.
In Python all modules have some built-in attributes.</description>
