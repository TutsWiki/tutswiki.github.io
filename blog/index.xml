Despite having all team members on board, the low productivity rate has to be explained by the Project Manager, who couldn&amp;rsquo;t plan the right course of actions or overlooked the breakdown in communications.
As simple and self-explanatory the term Project Manager sounds, his/her duty involves lots of multi-tasking and diversified knowledge in numerous areas.</description></item><item><title>How to setup and access QuestDB using Python</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/setup-access-questdb-python-notebook/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/setup-access-questdb-python-notebook/</guid><description>Reasons to love QuestDB?

It&amp;rsquo;s been over 30 years since the World Wide Web was introduced to the world. Over time, the internet took its toll and now has roughly around 45 million web pages compared to 10,000 websites earlier. We really do have come a long way.
Emerging from the primitive world of 2G signals we are now living in the era where mostly every device has an internet connection and if not of its own, gets one from another system.</description></item><item><title>How to install software in Linux (RPM/DEB systems)</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/install-software-linux-yum-rpm-apt-dpkg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/install-software-linux-yum-rpm-apt-dpkg/</guid><description>In this tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll be covering packages, package managers and how to find, install and remove software for most popular Linux distributions.
Package Typically when you install software in a Linux system you do so with a package. A package is just a collection of files that make up an application. Additionally, a package contains data about the application as well as any steps required to successfully install and remove that application.</description></item><item><title>Writing and Reading config files in Angular</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/read-write-config-files-in-angular/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/read-write-config-files-in-angular/</guid><description>Every app has some configurations to load. The most common is environment configurations which are required when you have multiple environments - local, dev, qa, uat and prod. Well this article will tell you where to store configurations and how to read them in Angular.
Storing config in Angular Let&amp;rsquo;s say we need to store the baseUrl of our app. Where do you think this should be added? There is a defined place for storing config in Angular and you should make most use of it.</description></item><item><title>Approximating Randomness</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/approximating-randomness/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/approximating-randomness/</guid><description>Generating random numbers from computers is essential to the development of certain kinds of software. Anything from modelling the environment, to a lottery machine, to determining the value of loot in a chest in an RPG, will require random number generation. At first it may seem strange that computers, which are capable of producing massive amounts of digits in a short time, would not be able to produce random numbers. The difficulty is that the computers we use, are constructed specifically to follow logical steps deterministically, so to generate numbers that are truly random from a system like our computers is virtually impossible.</description></item><item><title>How to convert a Python script to module</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/convert-python-script-to-module/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/convert-python-script-to-module/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s common to create small scripts which we want to combine into a larger script. We don&amp;rsquo;t want to copy and paste the code. We want to leave the working code in one file and use it in multiple places. Often we want to combine elements from multiple files to create more sophisticated scripts.
The problem we have is that when we import a script it actually starts running. This is generally not what we expect when we import a script so that we can reuse it.</description></item><item><title>Grunt Tutorial with Live Example</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/grunt-tutorial-example/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/grunt-tutorial-example/</guid><description>So, what is this thing called Grunt and how can it help you?

No I don’t mean your 500 line rails model. I mean a several gig binary or text file.
Try it. Watch your machine become unresponsive. Cry a little inside. Then reach for enumerable.
Ruby’s Enumerable module gives you a way of iterating over collections in a lazy manner, loading only what you need, when you need it.

Initially only the JVM, in the meantime it is also available for JavaScript. Essentially, you can write Clojure and either execute it as Java program or JavaScript program, of course each flavor has its unique features as well.
Clojure is a Lisp, thus the syntax may be foreign, but it is really, really easy since there are very few syntactic variations.</description></item><item><title>Abstract classes and interfaces in Python</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/abstract-classes-and-interfaces-in-python/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/abstract-classes-and-interfaces-in-python/</guid><description>Abstract base classes and interfaces are entities that are similar in purpose and meaning. Both the first and second are a peculiar way of documenting the code and help to limit (decouple) the interaction of individual abstractions in the program (classes).
Python is a very flexible language. One facet of this flexibility is the possibilities provided by metaprogramming. And although abstract classes and interfaces are not represented in the core of the language, the former were implemented in the standard abc module, and the latter in the Zope project (the zope.</description></item><item><title>How Deep Learning Helped Reducing Variability in Cardiovascular Imaging</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/deep-learning-cardiovascular-imaging/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/deep-learning-cardiovascular-imaging/</guid><description>Bay Labs, a San Francisco-based medical technology company which focuses on using artificial intelligence to improve cardiovascular imaging, has released a new software EchoMD AutoEF.

But what is the difference between them? When should you use one over another, let&amp;rsquo;s find out.
The official documentation describes them as:
list.append(x): Add an item to the end of the list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].

For example:
print &amp;#34;This is some line.&amp;#34; print &amp;#34;This is another line.&amp;#34; Output:
This is some line. This is another line. What if you want to avoid the newline and want to print both statements on same line? Well, there are 2 possible solutions.

Config files help creating the initial settings for any project, they help avoiding the hardcoded data.
Imagine if you migrate your server to a new host and suddenly your application stops working, now you have to go through your code and search/replace IP address of host at all the places.
