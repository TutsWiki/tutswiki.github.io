      <title>How to convert a Python script to module</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common to create small scripts which we want to combine into a larger script. We don&amp;rsquo;t want to copy and paste the code. We want to leave the working code in one file and use it in multiple places. Often we want to combine elements from multiple files to create more sophisticated scripts.
The problem we have is that when we import a script it actually starts running. This is generally not what we expect when we import a script so that we can reuse it.</description>

      <description>So, what is this thing called Grunt and how can it help you?
From the grunt documentation:
 “A task-based command line build tool for JavaScript projects”
 This means one simple thing. Stop repeating yourself and let Grunt do stuff for you. The Grunt ecosystem is constantly growing and being improved by open source contributors.

      <description>I wrote a command line script called noprocrast. This script updates /etc/hosts to make distracting websites unreachable from my machine:
sudo cp /etc/noprocrast_hosts /etc/hosts The corresponding /etc/noprocrast_hosts:

      <description>Getting permission errors when installing a module?
Are &amp;lsquo;sudo: node: command not found&amp;rsquo; errors taking away your precious sleeping hours?
How to fix? You have to remove any trace of node on your system, and reinstall it. It will soothe your pain:
echo &amp;#39;export PATH=$HOME/local/bin:$PATH&amp;#39; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; ~/.bashrc . ~/.bashrc mkdir ~/local &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ~/node-latest-install &amp;amp;&amp;amp; ~/node-latest-install curl https://nodejs.org/dist/node-latest.tar.gz | tar xz --strip-components=1 ./configure --prefix=~/local &amp;amp;&amp;amp; make install curl https://npmjs.org/install.sh | sh rm -rf ~/node-latest-install You are one/two steps/commands away from success.</description>

Let me try to write a monad tutorial that would&amp;rsquo;ve helped my past self understand what the fuss was about. I like concrete explanations that start with practical examples, without any annoying metaphors, and especially without any Haskell code. So here&amp;rsquo;s five examples that have something in common:

      <title>A Deeper Look at Ruby&#39;s Enumerable</title>

      <description>Have you ever needed to load a VERY large file in ruby? No I don’t mean your 500 line rails model. I mean a several gig binary or text file.
Try it. Watch your machine become unresponsive. Cry a little inside. Then reach for enumerable.
Ruby’s Enumerable module gives you a way of iterating over collections in a lazy manner, loading only what you need, when you need it. But it gives us so much more than that.</description>

      <description>Clojure is one of the most interesting new languages targeting the JVM. Initially only the JVM, in the meantime it is also available for JavaScript. Essentially, you can write Clojure and either execute it as Java program or JavaScript program, of course each flavor has its unique features as well.
Clojure is a Lisp, thus the syntax may be foreign, but it is really, really easy since there are very few syntactic variations.</description>

      <title>Abstract classes and interfaces in Python</title>

      <description>Abstract base classes and interfaces are entities that are similar in purpose and meaning. Both the first and second are a peculiar way of documenting the code and help to limit (decouple) the interaction of individual abstractions in the program (classes).
Python is a very flexible language. One facet of this flexibility is the possibilities provided by metaprogramming. And although abstract classes and interfaces are not represented in the core of the language, the former were implemented in the standard abc module, and the latter in the Zope project (the zope.</description>

      <description>Bay Labs, a San Francisco-based medical technology company which focuses on using artificial intelligence to improve cardiovascular imaging, has released a new software EchoMD AutoEF. It is being claimed that this software will help to reduce the variability in cardiovascular imaging.
The software uses deep learning techniques to accurately calculate the left ventricular ejection fraction.
What is Ejection Fraction? During each pumping cycle of our heart, it contracts and relaxes.</description>

      <description>A group of 9 cloud engineers at Google has refused to work on a project called air-gap due to which Google may lose a deal worth $10 billion. Google needs air-gap if it has to do some sensitive work with government agencies involving sensitive data (obviously military implications there). So this group of 9 basically just said they weren&amp;rsquo;t gonna do it. About 10-12 employees have resigned so far as part of this work strike.</description>

      <description>The trending news of yesterday was the acquisition of GitHub (the world&amp;rsquo;s leading software development platform) by Microsoft. This is a great deal for Microsoft which might put it in the position it was about 10 years ago in the software market. But a lot of open-source fans are unhappy with this.
A couple of years ago Microsoft was anti-open-source.
 &amp;ldquo;Open source is an intellectual-property destroyer. I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.</description>

      <description>append and extend are list methods in Python which can be used to combine multiple lists. But what is the difference between them? When should you use one over another, let&amp;rsquo;s find out.
The official documentation describes them as:
 list.append(x): Add an item to the end of the list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].
 list.extend(L): Extend the list by appending all the items in the given list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = L.</description>

      <title>How to print on same line with print in Python</title>

      <description>In Python, when you use the print function, it prints a new line at the end.
For example:
print &amp;#34;This is some line.&amp;#34; print &amp;#34;This is another line.&amp;#34; Output:
This is some line. This is another line. What if you want to avoid the newline and want to print both statements on same line? Well, there are 2 possible solutions.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure you must be aware about the importance of configuration files. Config files help creating the initial settings for any project, they help avoiding the hardcoded data.
Imagine if you migrate your server to a new host and suddenly your application stops working, now you have to go through your code and search/replace IP address of host at all the places. Config file comes to the rescue in such situation.</description>

      <description>Suppose you have a module named mymath.py, which has a couple of functions. You can import this module in your script and call these functions.
def int_sum(a, b): print a+b def some_other_function(): pass But, what if you want to run the module itself as a script?

      <description>If you are new to Python then you may have noticed if __name__ == &amp;quot;__main__&amp;quot; line in some python codes.
You may be wondering:
 What does that mean? What purpose does it serve? I don&amp;rsquo;t see it in all Python codes, so when should I use it exactly? Can you give me some examples?  Let me try to explain the above to you.
In Python all modules have some built-in attributes.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;re going to use the NYC 311 service request dataset again here, since it&amp;rsquo;s big and a bit unwieldy.</description>

      <description>8.1 Parsing Unix timestamps It&amp;rsquo;s not obvious how to deal with Unix timestamps in pandas &amp;ndash; it took me quite a while to figure this out. The file we&amp;rsquo;re using here is a popularity-contest file I found on my system at /var/log/popularity-contest.
Here&amp;rsquo;s an explanation of how this file works.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to hope that nothing in it is sensitive :)
import pandas as pd # Read it, and remove the last row popcon = pd.</description>
