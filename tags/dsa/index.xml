(Usually ascending or descending). Sorting is one of the most important categories of algorithms, it can significantly reduce the complexity of problems, and is generally used for efficient searching.
There are an ample number of sorting algorithms available like the Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Heap sort, Counting sort and more.</description></item><item><title>Tree Data Structure</title><link>https://tutswiki.com/data_structures_algorithms/tree_data_structure/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tutswiki.com/data_structures_algorithms/tree_data_structure/</guid><description>Data structures are different ways in which we can store or organise data. They can be classified into broadly two types.
1. Linear Data Structures Data structures in which data is stored in the sequential arrangement are called linear data structures. For example arrays, linked lists, queues etc. Please note that this does not imply storing data in consecutive locations. Data can be stored anywhere in the memory, though the linked list is a linear data structure, it does not store data in contiguous memory locations.</description></item></channel></rss>
