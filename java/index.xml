The OOPS principle looks at any problem as an interaction between various objects. This, in turn, helps us to solve real-world problems easily because most of it involves objects. Objects are described by their intrinsic properties ( in coding terms some base data ) and how they can interact within the object and also with other objects ( in coding terms some functionality over the data ).</description></item></channel></rss>
