	"content": " The post walks through the process of developing and deploying a simple web application in Clojure. After reading this you should be able to build your own app and deploy it to a production server.\nOur sample app performs addition for the user. The user enters a value in each of two text fields, the values are submitted to the app, and the app returns the corresponding sum. Eventually it will look like this:\nBefore beginning on the app, make sure that you have Leiningen installed.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  We\u0026rsquo;ll start with a minimal first version of the app. In a new directory adder, create a file project.clj with the following contents:\n(defproject adder \u0026#34;0.0.1\u0026#34; :description \u0026#34;Add two numbers.\u0026#34; :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure \u0026#34;1.2.0-beta1\u0026#34;] [org.clojure/clojure-contrib \u0026#34;1.2.0-beta1\u0026#34;] [ring/ring-core \u0026#34;0.2.5\u0026#34;] [ring/ring-devel \u0026#34;0.2.5\u0026#34;] [ring/ring-jetty-adapter \u0026#34;0.2.5\u0026#34;] [compojure \u0026#34;0.4.0\u0026#34;] [hiccup \u0026#34;0.2.6\u0026#34;]] :dev-dependencies [[lein-run \u0026#34;1.0.0-SNAPSHOT\u0026#34;]]) We\u0026rsquo;ll put the main app logic in the namespace adder.core. Create a file at src/adder/core.clj with this code:\n(ns adder.core (:use compojure.core) (:use hiccup.core) (:use hiccup.page-helpers)) (defn view-layout [\u0026amp; content] (html (doctype :xhtml-strict) (xhtml-tag \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; [:head [:meta {:http-equiv \u0026#34;Content-type\u0026#34; :content \u0026#34;text/html; charset=utf-8\u0026#34;}] [:title \u0026#34;adder\u0026#34;]] [:body content]))) (defn view-input [] (view-layout [:h2 \u0026#34;add two numbers\u0026#34;] [:form {:method \u0026#34;post\u0026#34; :action \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;} [:input.math {:type \u0026#34;text\u0026#34; :name \u0026#34;a\u0026#34;}] [:span.math \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;] [:input.math {:type \u0026#34;text\u0026#34; :name \u0026#34;b\u0026#34;}] [:br] [:input.action {:type \u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; :value \u0026#34;add\u0026#34;}]])) (defn view-output [a b sum] (view-layout [:h2 \u0026#34;two numbers added\u0026#34;] [:p.math a \u0026#34; + \u0026#34; b \u0026#34; = \u0026#34; sum] [:a.action {:href \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;} \u0026#34;add more numbers\u0026#34;])) (defn parse-input [a b] [(Integer/parseInt a) (Integer/parseInt b)]) (defroutes app (GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [] (view-input)) (POST \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [a b] (let [[a b] (parse-input a b) sum (+ a b)] (view-output a b sum)))) Also, put the following in script/run.clj:\n(use \u0026#39;ring.adapter.jetty) (require \u0026#39;adder.core) (run-jetty #\u0026#39;adder.core/app {:port 8080}) Now you\u0026rsquo;re ready to test the first version of the app:\nlein deps lein run script/run.clj open http://localhost:8080/ Check out your app in the browser. You should be to perform the simple addition described above.\nAs you use the app you\u0026rsquo;ll probably notice changes that you\u0026rsquo;d like to make. You might also notice that errors like giving foo as an input are not handled well. To fix this let\u0026rsquo;s apply some reloading and stacktrace middleware.\nStart by including the appropriate Ring middlewares into the adder.core namespace definition:\n(:use ring.middleware.reload) (:use ring.middleware.stacktrace) We\u0026rsquo;ll want to separate out the main app logic that we wrote earlier from the full, middleware wrapped application, so change (defroutes app to (defroutes handler and add the following at the bottom of the file:\n(def app (-\u0026gt; #\u0026#39;handler (wrap-reload \u0026#39;[adder.core]) (wrap-stacktrace))) After stopping your running server and restarting it with lein run script/run.clj, you should be able to see changes to your code in adder.core reflected immediately in the web interface. Also, if your application encounters any errors you will see a stacktrace indicating what went wrong:\nSpeaking of errors, we may want to address some of those in our application. If a user enters something other than a number into one of the fields, we should respond with a useful error message. Update the view-input function to:\n(defn view-input [\u0026amp; [a b]] (view-layout [:h2 \u0026#34;add two numbers\u0026#34;] [:form {:method \u0026#34;post\u0026#34; :action \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;} (if (and a b) [:p \u0026#34;those are not both numbers!\u0026#34;]) [:input.math {:type \u0026#34;text\u0026#34; :name \u0026#34;a\u0026#34; :value a}] [:span.math \u0026#34; + \u0026#34;] [:input.math {:type \u0026#34;text\u0026#34; :name \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; :value b}] [:br] [:input.action {:type \u0026#34;submit\u0026#34; :value \u0026#34;add\u0026#34;}]])) and update the POST route to:\n(POST \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [a b] (try (let [[a b] (parse-input a b) sum (+ a b)] (view-output a b sum)) (catch NumberFormatException e (view-input a b)))) You can immediately verify that your changes worked by trying some invalid input:\nWe should also handle the case where the user enters an unrecognized URL. To do that, require the Ring response middleware with:\n(:use ring.util.response) and then add a catchall route to the bottom of the routes list:\n(ANY \u0026#34;/*\u0026#34; [path] (redirect \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;)) Now when you visit e.g. /foo, you should be redirected back to the app\u0026rsquo;s main page at /.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  Our app is starting to shape up, but we’re missing some necessary application infrastructure. For one, the application is not doing any logging, which makes it hard to understand what it is doing. Lets fix that with some request logging middleware. Create a new file src/adder/middleware.clj with these contents:\n(ns adder.middleware) (defn- log [msg \u0026amp; vals] (let [line (apply format msg vals)] (locking System/out (println line)))) (defn wrap-request-logging [handler] (fn [{:keys [request-method uri] :as req}] (let [start (System/currentTimeMillis) resp (handler req) finish (System/currentTimeMillis) total (- finish start)] (log \u0026#34;request %s %s (%dms)\u0026#34; request-method uri total) resp))) Then pull this middleware into core with:\n(:use adder.middleware) and add it to the app by updating the middleware stack to look like:\n(def app (-\u0026gt; #\u0026#39;handler (wrap-request-logging) (wrap-reload \u0026#39;[adder.middleware adder.core]) (wrap-stacktrace))) Now each request will be noted in the app\u0026rsquo;s logs, along with the time it takes.\nAs soon as you try out the logging you\u0026rsquo;ll probably notice requests to /favicon.ico. Since our simple app doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a favicon, let\u0026rsquo;s let the browser know with a 404 response. Add a wrap-bounce-favicon function to the adder.middleware namespace:\n(defn wrap-bounce-favicon [handler] (fn [req] (if (= [:get \u0026#34;/favicon.ico\u0026#34;] [(:request-method req) (:uri req)]) {:status 404 :headers {} :body \u0026#34;\u0026#34;} (handler req)))) and then include it in the middleware stack by adding (wrap-bounce-favicon) immediately above (wrap-stacktrace).\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s add a bit of styling to our utilitarian app. To do this we\u0026rsquo;ll create and apply a CSS file that is served statically by the application. Put the following in public/adder.css:\n.math { font-family: Monaco, monospace; } .action { margin-top: 2em; } and update the :head markup in view-layout to look like:\n[:head [:meta {:http-equiv \u0026#34;Content-type\u0026#34; :content \u0026#34;text/html; charset=utf-8\u0026#34;}] [:title \u0026#34;adder\u0026#34;] [:link {:href \u0026#34;/adder.css\u0026#34; :rel \u0026#34;stylesheet\u0026#34; :type \u0026#34;text/css\u0026#34;}]] Next, include the necessary Ring middleware:\n(:use ring.middleware.file) (:use ring.middleware.file-info) and update the middleware stack to look like:\n(def app (-\u0026gt; #\u0026#39;handler (wrap-file \u0026#34;public\u0026#34;) (wrap-file-info) (wrap-request-logging) (wrap-reload \u0026#39;[adder.middleware adder.core]) (wrap-bounce-favicon) (wrap-stacktrace))) We should also write a few tests for our newly developed application. Create a file at test/adder/core_test.clj with the following contents:\n(ns adder.core-test (:use clojure.test) (:use adder.core)) (deftest parse-input-valid (is (= [1 2] (parse-input \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;)))) (deftest parse-input-invalid (is (thrown? NumberFormatException (parse-input \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34; \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;)))) (deftest view-output-valid (let [html (view-output 1 2 3)] (is (re-find #\u0026#34;two numbers added\u0026#34; html)))) (deftest handle-input-valid (let [resp (handler {:uri \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; :request-method :get})] (is (= 200 (:status resp))) (is (re-find #\u0026#34;add two numbers\u0026#34; (:body resp))))) (deftest handle-add-valid (let [resp (handler {:uri \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; :request-method :post :params {\u0026#34;a\u0026#34; \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; \u0026#34;2\u0026#34;}})] (is (= 200 (:status resp))) (is (re-find #\u0026#34;1 \\+ 2 = 3\u0026#34; (:body resp))))) (deftest handle-add-invalid (let [resp (handler {:uri \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; :request-method :post :params {\u0026#34;a\u0026#34; \u0026#34;foo\u0026#34; \u0026#34;b\u0026#34; \u0026#34;bar\u0026#34;}})] (is (= 200 (:status resp))) (is (re-find #\u0026#34;those are not both numbers\u0026#34; (:body resp))))) (deftest handle-catchall (let [resp (handler {:uri \u0026#34;/foo\u0026#34; :request-method :get})] (is (= 302 (:status resp))) (is (= \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; (get-in resp [:headers \u0026#34;Location\u0026#34;]))))) You can verify that they all pass by running lein test.\nNow that we have some tests we\u0026rsquo;re ready to start thinking about deploying this app to production. We\u0026rsquo;ll want the app to behave slightly differently in production and development, so we\u0026rsquo;ll need a way to differentiate between the two environments. I\u0026rsquo;ll use the environment variable APP_ENV to define production? and development? vars in the adder.core namespace:\n(def production? (= \u0026#34;production\u0026#34; (get (System/getenv) \u0026#34;APP_ENV\u0026#34;))) (def development? (not production?)) Use this var to update the middleware stack to look like:\n(def app (-\u0026gt; #\u0026#39;handler (wrap-file \u0026#34;public\u0026#34;) (wrap-file-info) (wrap-request-logging) (wrap-if development? wrap-reload \u0026#39;[adder.middleware adder.core]) (wrap-bounce-favicon) (wrap-exception-logging) (wrap-if production? wrap-failsafe) (wrap-if development? wrap-stacktrace))) This code will enable a public-facing failsafe middleware in production while keeping the stacktrace middleware in development. We\u0026rsquo;ll also limit code reloading to development. Finally, we\u0026rsquo;ll add exception logging in both cases for additional visibility. This updated stack relies on several new functions in adder.middleware. Add the following to the adder.middleware namespace declaration:\n(:require [clj-stacktrace.repl :as strp]) and to the adder.middleware body:\n(defn wrap-if [handler pred wrapper \u0026amp; args] (if pred (apply wrapper handler args) handler)) (defn wrap-exception-logging [handler] (fn [req] (try (handler req) (catch Exception e (log \u0026#34;Exception:\\n%s\u0026#34; (strp/pst-str e)) (throw e))))) (defn wrap-failsafe [handler] (fn [req] (try (handler req) (catch Exception e {:status 500 :headers {\u0026#34;Content-Type\u0026#34; \u0026#34;text/plain\u0026#34;} :body \u0026#34;We\u0026#39;re sorry, something went wrong.\u0026#34;})))) The site will not run on port 8080 in production, so we\u0026rsquo;ll need a way to specify the port to the run script. We\u0026rsquo;ll use the PORT environment variable. Update the body of script/run.clj to the following:\n(let [port (Integer/parseInt (get (System/getenv) \u0026#34;PORT\u0026#34; \u0026#34;8080\u0026#34;))] (run-jetty #\u0026#39;adder.core/app {:port port})) Deploying to Amazon EC2 Now we’re ready to put this app into production. I\u0026rsquo;ll walk through the steps needed for to deploying to EC2 using the standard EC2 command line tools, but the process would be similar for other hosting providers.\nStart by setting up a security group and SSH keypair for the application:\nec2-add-group adder -d \u0026#34;adder deployment\u0026#34; ec2-authorize adder -P tcp -p 22 ec2-authorize adder -P tcp -p 80 mkdir -p dev ec2-add-keypair adder | tail -n +2 \u0026gt; dev/adder.pem chmod 600 dev/adder.pem Then allocate a server based on a public Ubunut AMI and wait for it to come up:\nec2-run-instances ami-2d4aa444 -g adder -k adder \\  -n 1 -t m1.small -z us-east-1a watch ec2-describe-instances Set some local environment variables to make subsequent commands easier:\nexport ADDER_PEM=dev/adder.pem export ADDER_HOST=\u0026lt;ec2-public-ip\u0026gt; To set up the server, SSH in\nssh -i $ADDER_PEM ubuntu@$ADDER_HOST and run a few commands to install Java and set up the directory structure:\nsudo su root curl -L -o install-java.sh http://bit.ly/b5lesP bash install-java.sh mkdir -p /var/log/adder /var/adder chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /var/adder We\u0026rsquo;ll control the server process using Ubuntu\u0026rsquo;s upstart. Put the following upstart configuration file in deploy/adder.conf:\nscript export PORT=80 export APP_ENV=production cd /var/adder java -cp \u0026#34;lib/*:src/\u0026#34; clojure.main script/run.clj \\  \u0026gt;\u0026gt; /var/log/adder/adder.log 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 end script and then place it in the appropriate spot on the server with:\nscp -i $ADDER_PEM deploy/adder.conf \\  ubuntu@$ADDER_HOST:/tmp/adder.conf ssh -i $ADDER_PEM ubuntu@$ADDER_HOST \\  \u0026#34;sudo mv /tmp/adder.conf /etc/init/adder.conf\u0026#34; Create a list in deploy/exclude.txt of files that should not be deployed to the production server:\n.git .gitignore deploy test classes Now install the app\u0026rsquo;s files on the server with:\nrsync --rsh=\u0026#39;ssh -i \u0026#39;$ADDER_PEM \\  -vr --delete --exclude-from deploy/exclude.txt \\  ./ ubuntu@$ADDER_HOST:/var/adder/ After the first rsync completes, start the server with:\nssh -i $ADDER_PEM ubuntu@$ADDER_HOST \u0026#34;sudo start adder\u0026#34; and check that it works by opening the production site from your local machine:\nopen http://$ADDER_HOST/ If you want to deploy a change, rsync up your code and then run:\nssh -i $ADDER_PEM ubuntu@$ADDER_HOST \u0026#34;sudo restart adder\u0026#34; I hope this post helps you develop and deploy your own Clojure web applications.\n"

	"description": "Threaded servers use multiple concurrently-executing threads that each handle one client request, while evented servers run a single event loop that handles events for all connected clients.",
	"content": "Broadly speaking, there are two ways to handle concurrent requests to a server. Threaded servers use multiple concurrently-executing threads that each handle one client request, while evented servers run a single event loop that handles events for all connected clients.\nTo chose between the threaded and evented approaches you need to consider the load profile of the server. This post describes a simple mathematical model for reasoning about these load profiles and their implications for server design.\nSuppose that requests to a server take c CPU milliseconds and w wall clock milliseconds to execute. The CPU time is spent actively computing on behalf of the request, while the wall clock time is the total time including that time spent waiting for calls to external resources. For example, a web application request might take 5 ms of CPU time c and 95 ms waiting for a database call for a total wall time w of 100 ms. Let’s also say that a threaded version of the server can maintain up to t threads before performance degrades because of scheduling and context-switching overhead. Finally, we’ll assume single-core servers.\nIf a server is CPU bound then it will be able to respond to at most\n(/ 1000 c) requests per second. For example, if each requests takes 2 ms of CPU time then the CPU can only handle\n(/ 1000 2) =\u0026gt; 500\nrequests per second.\nIf the server is thread bound then it can handle at most\n(* t (/ 1000 w))\nrequests per second. This expression is similar to the one for CPU time, but here we multiply the result by t to account for the t concurrent threads.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  The throughput of a threaded server is the minimum of the CPU and thread bounds since it is subject to both constraints. An evented server is not subject to the thread constraint since it only uses one thread; its throughput is given by the CPU bound. We can express this as follows:\n(defn max-request-rate [t c w] (let [cpu-bound (/ 1000 c) thread-bound (* t (/ 1000 w))] {:threaded (min cpu-bound thread-bound) :evented cpu-bound})) Now we\u0026rsquo;ll consider some different types of servers and see how they might perform with threaded and evented implementations.\nFor the examples below I\u0026rsquo;ll use a t value of 25. This is a modest number of threads that most threading implementations can handle.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start with a classic example: an HTTP proxy server. These servers require very little CPU time, so say c is 0.1 ms. Suppose that the downstream servers can receive the relay within milliseconds for a wall time w of, say, 10 ms. Then we have\n(max-request-rate 25 0.1 10) =\u0026gt; {:threaded 2500, :evented 10000} In this case we expect a threaded server to be able to handle 2500 requests per second and an evented server 10000 requests per second. The higher performance of the evented server implies that the thread bound is limiting for the threaded server.\nAnother familiar example is the web application server. Let\u0026rsquo;s first consider the case where we have a lightweight app that does not access any external resources. In this case the request parsing and response generation might take a few milliseconds; say c is 2 ms. Since no blocking calls are made this is the value of w as well. Then\n(max-request-rate 25 2 2) =\u0026gt; {:threaded 500, :evented 500} Here the threaded server performs as well as the evented server because the workload is CPU bound.\nSuppose we have a more heavyweight app that is making calls to external resources like the filesystem and database. In this case the amount of CPU time will be somewhat larger that the previous case but still modest; say c is 5 ms. But now that we are waiting on external resources we should expect a w value of, say, 100 ms. Then we have\n(max-request-rate 25 5 100) =\u0026gt; {:threaded 200, :evented 200} Even though we are making a lot of blocking calls, the workload is still CPU bound and the threaded and evented servers will therefore perform comparably.\nSuppose now that we are implementing a background service such as an RSS feed fetcher that makes high-latency requests to external services and then performs minimal processing of the results. In this case c may be quite low, say 2 ms, but w will be high, say 250 ms. Then\n(max-request-rate 25 2 250) =\u0026gt; {:threaded 100, :evented 500} Here an evented server will perform better. The CPU load is sufficiently low and the external resource latency sufficiently high that the blocking external calls limit the threaded implementation.\nFinally, consider the case of long polling clients. Here clients establish a connection to the server and the server responds only when it has a message it wants to send to the client. Suppose that we have a lightweight app such that c is 1 ms, but that response messages are sent to the client after 10 seconds such that the w value is 10000 ms. Then\n(max-request-rate 25 1 10000) =\u0026gt; {:threaded 2.5, :evented 1000} If the server were really limited to 25 threads and each client required its own thread, we could only allow 2.5 new connections per second if we wanted to avoid exceeding the thread allocation. An evented server on the other hand could saturate the CPU by accepting 1000 requests per second.\nEven if we increase the maximum number of threads t by an order of magnitude to 250, the evented approach still fares better:\n(max-request-rate 250 1 10000) =\u0026gt; {:threaded 25, :evented 1000} Indeed, a threaded server would need to maintain 10000 threads in order to be able to accept requests at the rate of the evented server.\nNow that we have seen some specific examples of the model we should step back and note the patterns. In general, an evented architecture becomes more favorable as the ratio of wall time w to CPU time c increases, i.e. as proportionally more time is spent waiting on external resources. Also, the viability of a threaded architecture depends on the strength of the underlying threading implementation; the higher the thread threshold t, the more wait time can be tolerated before eventing becomes necessary.\nIn addition to the quantitative performance implications captured by this model, there are several qualitative factors that influence the suitability of threaded and evented architectures for particular servers.\nOne factor is the fit of the server architecture to the work that the server is doing internally. For example, proxying is well suited to evented architectures because the work being done is fundamentally evented: upon receiving an input chunk from the client the chunk is relayed to a downstream server. In contrast, the business logic implemented by web applications is more naturally described in a synchronous style. The callbacks required by an evented architecture become unwieldy in complex application code.\nAnother consideration is memory coordination and consistency. Evented servers executing in a single event loop do not need to worry about the correctness and performance implications of maintaining consistent shared memory, but this may be a problem for threaded servers. Threaded servers therefore attempt to minimize memory shared among threads. This approach works well for the servers that we discussed above - proxies, web applications, background workers, and long poll endpoints - as none of them need to share state internally across client sessions. But fundamentally stateful servers like caches and databases cannot avoid this problem.\nThe threaded approach can be a non-starter if the underlying platform does not support proper threading. In these cases blocking calls to external resources prevent the process from using the CPU in other threads, even if the blocker is not itself using the CPU. C Ruby falls into this category. In these cases t is effectively 1, making evented architectures relatively more appealing.\nIn the other extreme, the assumption of t being 25 or even 250 may be too modest for some platforms. These low t values are an artifact of threading implementations and not intrinsic to the threading model itself. More scalable threading implementations make threaded servers viable for higher w to c ratios.\nAn evented approach can be compromised by a lack of evented libraries for the platform. For evented servers to perform optimally, all external resources must be accessed through nonblocking libraries. Such libraries are not always available, especially on platforms that have typically used threaded/blocking models like the JVM and C Ruby. Fortunately this situation is improving as developers publish more nonblocking libraries in response to the demand from implementors of evented servers. Indeed, the requirement of pervasive evented libraries for optimal performance is one reason that node.js is so compelling for building evented servers.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  "

	"content": " Clojure’s vars provide a nice mechanism for managing dynamically bound state, but you need to be careful with vars when moving computations across thread boundaries. For example, suppose we implement the following timeout function:\n(import \u0026#39;(java.util.concurrent Future TimeUnit)) (defn timeout1 [millis op] (.get (future-call op) millis TimeUnit/MILLISECONDS)) The function timeout1 sends the operation op to be computed in a separate, timeout-bound thread. If the operation completes within millis milliseconds, timeout1 returns the result of that operation, otherwise it throws an exception:\n(timeout1 1000 #(inc 1)) =\u0026gt; 2 (timeout1 1000 #(Thread/sleep 2000)) ; throws java.util.concurrent.TimeoutException  This timeout implementation demonstrates the potential problem with using vars and threads:\n(def a-var 3) (binding [a-var 4] (inc a-var)) =\u0026gt; 5 (timeout1 1000 #(binding [a-var 4] (inc a-var))) =\u0026gt; 5 (binding [a-var 4] (timeout1 1000 #(inc a-var))) =\u0026gt; 4 If we rebind a-var within the timeout thread, we get the expected result of 5. But if we rebind a-var outside of the timeout thread, the computation sees the root value of 3 for a-var, not the thread-local value of 4.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  To fix this, we need to “pass the environment” of the calling thread to the computation thread:\n(defn timeout2 [millis op] (let [env (get-thread-bindings) env-op #(with-bindings* env op)] (.get (future-call env-op) millis TimeUnit/MILLISECONDS))) (timeout2 1000 #(binding [a-var 4] (inc a-var))) =\u0026gt; 5 (binding [a-var 4] (timeout2 1000 #(inc a-var))) =\u0026gt; 5 Here we capture the environment in the context of the caller and inject it into the timeout thread using with-bindings*. Now that the timeout thread sees the same thread-local environment as the caller, the external binding of a-var works as expected.\nFinally, we can extract this pattern into a macro passing-bindings that can be used to pass an environment across thread boundaries:\n(defmacro passing-bindings [[in-env-sym] body] `(let [env# (get-thread-bindings) ~in-env-sym (fn [op#] #(with-bindings* env# op#))] ~body)) (defn timeout3 [millis op] (passing-bindings [in-env] (.get (future-call (in-env op)) millis TimeUnit/MILLISECONDS))) (binding [a-var 4] (timeout3 1000 #(inc a-var))) =\u0026gt; 5 Help improve this content Feel free to edit this page to fix any typos or add more insights.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  "

	"content": " I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan of monads, but I understand them. They\u0026rsquo;re not rocket science. Let me try to write a monad tutorial that would\u0026rsquo;ve helped my past self understand what the fuss was about. I like concrete explanations that start with practical examples, without any annoying metaphors, and especially without any Haskell code. So here\u0026rsquo;s five examples that have something in common:\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  1) If a function has type A → B, and another function has type B → C, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → C.\n2) Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about functions that can return multiple values. We can model these as functions of type A → List\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;. There is a natural way to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → List\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, and another function has type B → List\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → List\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;. The \u0026ldquo;composition\u0026rdquo; works by joining together all the intermediate lists of values into one. This is similar to MapReduce, which also collects together lists of results returned by individual workers.\n3) Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about functions that either return a value, or fail somewhere along the way. We can model these as functions of type A → Option\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, where Option\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; is a type that contains either a value of type B, or a special value None. There is a natural way to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → Option\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, and another function has type B → Option\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → Option\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;. The \u0026ldquo;composition\u0026rdquo; works just like regular function composition, except if the first function returns None, then it gets passed along and the second function doesn\u0026rsquo;t get called. This way you can have a \u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo; in your code, and check for None only at the end.\n4) Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about functions that call a remote machine asynchronously. We can model these as functions of type A → Promise\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, where Promise\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; is a type that will eventually contain a value of type B, which you can wait for. There is a natural way to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → Promise\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, and another function has type B → Promise\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → Promise\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;. The \u0026ldquo;composition\u0026rdquo; is an asynchronous operation that waits for the first promise to return a value, then calls the second function on that value. This is known in some languages as \u0026ldquo;promise pipelining\u0026rdquo;. It can sometimes make remote calls faster, because you can send both calls to the remote machine in the same request.\n5) Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about functions that do input or output in a pure functional language, like Haskell. We can define IO\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; as the type of opaque \u0026ldquo;IO instructions\u0026rdquo; that describe how to do some IO and return a value of type A. These \u0026ldquo;instructions\u0026rdquo; might eventually be executed by the runtime, but can also be freely passed around and manipulated before that. For example, to create instructions for reading a String from standard input, we\u0026rsquo;d have a function of type Void → IO\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;, and to create instructions for writing a String to standard output, we\u0026rsquo;d have String → IO\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt;. There is a natural way to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → IO\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, and another function has type B → IO\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → IO\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;. The \u0026ldquo;composition\u0026rdquo; works by just doing the IO in sequence. Eventually the whole program returns one huge complicated IO instruction with explicit sequencing inside, which is then passed to the runtime for execution. That\u0026rsquo;s how Haskell works.\nAnother thing to note is that each of the examples above also has a natural \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo; function, such that \u0026ldquo;composing\u0026rdquo; it with any other function F gives you F again. For ordinary function composition, it\u0026rsquo;s the ordinary identity function A → A. For lists, it\u0026rsquo;s the function A → List\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that creates a single-element list. For options, it\u0026rsquo;s the function A → Option\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that takes a value and returns an option containing that value. For promises, it\u0026rsquo;s the function A → Promise\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that takes a value and makes an immediately fulfilled promise out of it. And for IO, it\u0026rsquo;s the function A → IO\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually do any IO.\nAt this point we could go all mathematical and talk about how \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; is like number multiplication, and \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo; is like the number 1, and then go off into monoids and categories and functors and other things that are frankly boring to me. So let\u0026rsquo;s not go there! Whew!\nInstead, to stay more on the programming track, let\u0026rsquo;s use a Java-like syntax to define an interface Monad with two methods \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo;. The five examples above will correspond to five different concrete classes that implement that interface, for different choices of the type parameter T.\nThe main complication is that the type parameter T must not be a simple type, like String. Instead it must be itself a generic type, like List, Option or Promise. The reason is that we want to have a single implementation of Monad\u0026lt;Option\u0026gt;, not separate implementations like Monad\u0026lt;Option\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;\u0026gt;, Monad\u0026lt;Option\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;\u0026gt; and so on. Java and C# don\u0026rsquo;t support generic types whose parameters are themselves generic types (the technical term is \u0026ldquo;higher-kinded types\u0026rdquo;), but C++ has some support for them, called \u0026ldquo;template template parameters\u0026rdquo;. Some functional languages have higher-kinded types, like Haskell, while others don\u0026rsquo;t have them, like ML.\nAnyway, here\u0026rsquo;s what it would look like in Java, if Java supported such things:\ninterface Monad\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { \u0026lt;A\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;A, T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;\u0026gt; identity(); \u0026lt;A, B, C\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;A, T\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;\u0026gt; compose( Function\u0026lt;A, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt; first, Function\u0026lt;B, T\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;\u0026gt; second ); } class OptionMonad implements Monad\u0026lt;Option\u0026gt; { public \u0026lt;A\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;A, Option\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;\u0026gt; identity() { // Implementation omitted, figure it out  } public \u0026lt;A, B, C\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;A, Option\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;\u0026gt; compose( Function\u0026lt;A, Option\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt; first, Function\u0026lt;B, Option\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;\u0026gt; second ) { // Implementation omitted, do it yourself  } } Defining Monad as an interface allows us to implement some general functionality that will work on all monads. For example, there\u0026rsquo;s a well known function \u0026ldquo;liftM\u0026rdquo; that converts a function of type A → B into a function of type List\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; → List\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, or Promise\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; → Promise\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, or anything else along these lines. For different monads, liftM will do different useful things, e.g. liftM on lists is just the familiar \u0026ldquo;map\u0026rdquo; function in disguise. The implementation of liftM with lambda expressions would be very short, though a little abstract:\n\u0026lt;T, A, B\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt; liftM( Function\u0026lt;A, B\u0026gt; func, Monad\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; monad ) { return (T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; ta) -\u0026gt; monad.compose( () -\u0026gt; ta, (A a) -\u0026gt; monad.identity().apply(func.apply(a)) ).apply(void); } Or if you don\u0026rsquo;t like lambda expressions, here\u0026rsquo;s a version without them:\n\u0026lt;T, A, B\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt; liftM( Function\u0026lt;A, B\u0026gt; func, Monad\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; monad ) { return new Function\u0026lt;T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt;() { public T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; apply (T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; ta) { return monad.compose( new Function\u0026lt;Void, T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;\u0026gt;() { public T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; apply() { return ta; } }, new Function\u0026lt;A, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt;() { public T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; apply(A a) { return monad.identity().apply(func.apply(a)); } } ).apply(void); } } } Monads first became popular as a nice way to deal with IO instructions in a pure language, treating them as first-class values that can be passed around, like in my example 5. Imperative languages don\u0026rsquo;t need monads for IO, but they often face a similar problem of \u0026ldquo;option chaining\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;error chaining\u0026rdquo;, like in my example 3. For example, the option types in Rust or Swift would benefit from having a \u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo; through the code and a centralized place to handle errors, which is exactly the thing that monads would give you.\nSome people think that monads are about side effects, like some sort of escape hatch for Haskell. That\u0026rsquo;s wrong, because you could always do IO without monads, and in fact the first version of Haskell didn\u0026rsquo;t use them. In any case, only two of my five examples involve side effects. Monads are more like a design pattern for composing functions, which shows up in many places. I think the jury is still out on whether imperative/OO languages need to use monads explicitly, but it might be useful to notice them when they appear in your code implicitly.\nHelp improve this content Feel free to edit this page to fix any typos or add more insights.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  "

I use these methods when I need to determine the \u0026lsquo;distance or difference\u0026rsquo; in a set of numbers or objects. each_cons simply gives us a \u0026lsquo;sliding\u0026rsquo; window of our list so we can compare multiple items in our list.\nnumbers = [1,3,5,8,10,54,99] cards = [5,3,4,6,2] # get only the values where the distance is greater than 10 numbers.each_cons(2).select {|a,b| b-a\u0026gt;10 } #=\u0026gt; [[10, 54], [54, 99]] # determine if the hand is a straight cards.sort.each_cons(5).all? do |series| (series.first..series.last).to_a == series end #=\u0026gt; true Our first example shows how to get the elements in the numbers list that are over 10 units in difference. I do this by using each_cons to give me a sliding window of 2 elements at a time. This give me:\nAt each step on the way I check b-a and see if that is greater than 10. If so, the select will return those groups of elements.\nThe second example simply sorts a set of \u0026lsquo;cards\u0026rsquo; and then looking at all 5 cards through each_cons and comparing the scores to see if they are in order and in sequence (a+1==b).\nLet’s play off this example a bit more, this time with dice. If we have to implement small and large straights, we have a similar problem, with a similar solution:\nFor the small straight we get 2 windows, becuase there are 5 values in the list and we are calling each_cons(4). Therefore we want a postfix of any? because either of the windows can be a run of 4.\nIn the second example we use all? to be more explicit, yet any? would have worked as well, because in the large straight, we only have one sliding window, 2,3,4,5,6.\nany? all? none? These have to be a few of my favorite methods in enumerable.\nGiven no args, they take a list of bool values and returns a bool. So [true, true, false].all? #=\u0026gt; false.\nKinda useful, but not really. If we pass it a block of code however.. now we can do something useful. Consider this example:\n.any? and .none? do what you probably think. Where .all? only returns true if ALL the conditions and elements match up, .any? returns true if ANY of them match, and .none? returns true if there were NO matches.\nWeird things like look-ahead? Say you have a file to read in line by line. You need to compare the current line to the next line to look for duplicates. each_cons(2) to the rescue!\nThis will tell us of the current line and the following line are the same.\n More uses for each_cons averages distances smoothing plots graphing geometry  Help improve this content Feel free to edit this page to fix any typos or add more insights.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  "

	"description": "A newbie friendly introduction to REST API in Clojure.",
	"content": " Clojure is one of the most interesting new languages targeting the JVM. Initially only the JVM, in the meantime it is also available for JavaScript. Essentially, you can write Clojure and either execute it as Java program or JavaScript program, of course each flavor has its unique features as well.\nClojure is a Lisp, thus the syntax may be foreign, but it is really, really easy since there are very few syntactic variations. The language “Lisp” is very lean and usually easily learned.\nIn this post, we’re going to create a complete REST application from scratch. There are already some (very) good tutorials available, but some are not quite up to date (see Heroku’s Devcenter or Mark McGranaghan for good ones).

A GET to /documents/[ID] should return the document with the given id, or 404 if the document does not exist. A PUT to /documents/[ID] should update the document with the given id and replace title and text with those from the document in the uploaded body. A DELETE to /documents/[ID] should delete the document with the given id and return 204 (NO CONTENT) in any case.

We’re going to work with JSON, so let’s include some Ring middlewares to setup response headers (wrap-json-response) and parse request bodies (wrap-json-body) for us. A middleware is just a wrapper around a handler, thus it can pre- and post-process the whole request/response cycle.\n(def app (-\u0026gt; (handler/api app-routes) (middleware/wrap-json-body) (middleware/wrap-json-response))) We switched also from the handler/site template to handler/api which is more appropriate for REST APIs (documentation).\nNext let’s define the routes for our application:\n(defroutes app-routes (context \u0026#34;/documents\u0026#34; [] (defroutes documents-routes (GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [] (get-all-documents)) (POST \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; {body :body} (create-new-document body)) (context \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; [id] (defroutes document-routes (GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [] (get-document id)) (PUT \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; {body :body} (update-document id body)) (DELETE \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [] (delete-document id)))))) (route/not-found \u0026#34;Not Found\u0026#34;)) We define GET and POST for the context \u0026ldquo;/documents, and GET, PUT, DELETE for the context \u0026ldquo;:id\u0026rdquo; on top of that. :id is a placeholder and can then be injected into our parameter vector. The POST and PUT request have a special parameter body for the parsed body (this parameter is provided by the wrap-json-body middleware. For more on routes, take a look at Compojure’s documentation.\nBefore we define the functions to carry out the requests, let’s fix the imports and open a pool of database connections to work with.\nThe namespace declaration is used to define which namespaces shall be made available by Clojure.\n(ns clojure-rest.handler (:import com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource) (:use compojure.core) (:use cheshire.core) (:use ring.util.response) (:require [compojure.handler :as handler] [ring.middleware.json :as middleware] [clojure.java.jdbc :as sql] [compojure.route :as route])) We import C3P0’s ComboPooledDataSource, a plain Java class. Next, we fetch the functions defined in compojure.core, cheshire.core, and ring.util.response into our namespace, they can be used without qualifying. Finally we require some more libraries, this time with a qualifier to prevent name clashes or to support nicer separation. I’m not sure when to make the cut between :use and :require yet, so the cut is abitrary.\n(def db-config {:classname \u0026#34;org.h2.Driver\u0026#34; :subprotocol \u0026#34;h2\u0026#34; :subname \u0026#34;mem:documents\u0026#34; :user \u0026#34;\u0026#34; :password \u0026#34;\u0026#34;}) Note, we use a in-memory database. If you’d like to keep your database between restarts, you could use :subname \u0026quot;/tmp/documents\u0026quot; for example.\nNext we open a pool of connections. C3P0 has no Clojure wrapper, so we deal with Java classes and objects directly (hence a bit more code).\n(defn pool [config] (let [cpds (doto (ComboPooledDataSource.) (.setDriverClass (:classname config)) (.setJdbcUrl (str \u0026#34;jdbc:\u0026#34; (:subprotocol config) \u0026#34;:\u0026#34; (:subname config))) (.setUser (:user config)) (.setPassword (:password config)) (.setMaxPoolSize 6) (.setMinPoolSize 1) (.setInitialPoolSize 1))] {:datasource cpds})) (def pooled-db (delay (pool db-config))) (defn db-connection [] @pooled-db) Since we deal with a in-memory database, we need to create our table now.\n(sql/with-connection (db-connection) (sql/create-table :documents [:id \u0026#34;varchar(256)\u0026#34; \u0026#34;primary key\u0026#34;] [:title \u0026#34;varchar(1024)\u0026#34;] [:text :varchar])) The intent should be easy to understand, for the details take a look at the java.jdbc documentation. We create a table documents with a :id, :title, and :text column. Note that the database column is called id, not :id.\nThe only thing missing are the functions to actually perform the actions requested by our clients.\nTo return a single document with a given id, we could come up with this:\n(defn get-document [id] (sql/with-connection (db-connection) (sql/with-query-results results [\u0026#34;select * from documents where id = ?\u0026#34; id] (cond (empty? results) {:status 404} :else (response (first results)))))) It reads like this: when called with an id, open a database connection, perform select * from documents where id = ? with the given id as parameter. If the result is empty, return 404, otherwise return the first (and only) document as response.\nThe response call will convert the document into JSON, this functionality is provided by wrap-json-response, which also sets the correct Content-Type etc.\nAnother nice one is the creation of new documents:\n(defn uuid [] (str (java.util.UUID/randomUUID))) (defn create-new-document [doc] (let [id (uuid)] (sql/with-connection (db-connection) (let [document (assoc doc \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; id)] (sql/insert-record :documents document))) (get-document id))) Here we use Java’s UUID generator (without import, hence the full package name) to generate a new id for each document created. The second let statement is responsible to replace the user-provided id (if any) with our generated one. Remember that Clojure’s datastructures are immutable, so we need to use the document variable thereafter, instead of the doc which still contains the old (or no) id.\nReturning the document is delegated to the get-document function.\nThe complete handler.clj To round the post up, here is the whole program:\n(ns clojure-rest.handler (:import com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource) (:use compojure.core) (:use cheshire.core) (:use ring.util.response) (:require [compojure.handler :as handler] [ring.middleware.json :as middleware] [clojure.java.jdbc :as sql] [compojure.route :as route])) (def db-config {:classname \u0026#34;org.h2.Driver\u0026#34; :subprotocol \u0026#34;h2\u0026#34; :subname \u0026#34;mem:documents\u0026#34; :user \u0026#34;\u0026#34; :password \u0026#34;\u0026#34;}) (defn pool [config] (let [cpds (doto (ComboPooledDataSource.)

	"tags": [],
	"description": "Abstract classes, methods and Zope interfaces, adapters in Python",
	"content": " Abstract base classes and interfaces are entities that are similar in purpose and meaning. Both the first and second are a peculiar way of documenting the code and help to limit (decouple) the interaction of individual abstractions in the program (classes).\nPython is a very flexible language. One facet of this flexibility is the possibilities provided by metaprogramming. And although abstract classes and interfaces are not represented in the core of the language, the former were implemented in the standard abc module, and the latter in the Zope project (the zope.interfaces module).\nIt makes no sense to use both at the same time, and therefore each programmer must determine for himself which tool to use when designing applications.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  Abstract base classes (abc) Starting from version 2.6 of the language, the abc module is included in the standard library, which adds abstract base classes (hereinafter ABC) to the language.\nABC allows you to define a class, indicating which methods or properties must be overridden in inherited classes:\nfrom abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod, abstractproperty class Movable(): __metaclass __ = ABCMeta @abstractmethod def move(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Move object\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; @abstractproperty def speed(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Object speed\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Thus, if we want to use an object with the ability to move and a certain speed in the code, then we should use the Movable class as one of the base classes.\nThe presence of the necessary methods and attributes of the object is now guaranteed by the presence of abstractmethod and abstractproperty.\nclass Car(Movable): def __init__: self.speed = 10 self.x = 0 def move(self): self.c += self.speed def speed(self): return self.speed assert issubclass (Car, Movable) assert ininstance (Car(), Movable) It can be seen that the concept of ABC fits well into the class inheritance hierarchy, it is easy to use them, and the implementation, if you look into the source code of the abc module, is very simple. Abstract classes are used in the standard collections and number modules, defining the methods of custom inherited classes necessary for definition.\nDetails and considerations for using ABC can be found in PEP-3119.\nInterfaces (zope.interfaces) The Zope Toolkit (ZTK) is a set of libraries intended for reuse by projects to develop web applications or web frameworks. It is developed by the contributors of the Zope Foundation. The zope framework has evolved into a set of almost independent components. The glue that holds the components together is the interfaces and the adapters based on them.\nThe zope.interfaces module is the result of this work.\nIn the simplest case, using interfaces is similar to ABC:\nimport zope.interface class IVehicle(zope.interface.Interface): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Any moving thing\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; speed = zope.interface.Attribute(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Movement speed\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) def move(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Make a single step\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; class Car(object): zope.interface.implements (IVehicle) def __init__: self.speed = 1 self.location = 1 def move (self): self.location = self.speed * 1 print(\u0026#34;moved!\u0026#34;) assert IVehicle.implementedBy (Car) assert IVehicle.providedBy (Car ()) The interface declaratively shows what attributes and methods the object should have. Moreover, the class implements the interface, and the object of the class provides. You should pay attention to the difference between these concepts!\n\u0026ldquo;Implementing\u0026rdquo; an interface means that only the \u0026ldquo;produced\u0026rdquo; entity will have the required properties; and \u0026ldquo;providing\u0026rdquo; an interface speaks of the specific capabilities of the entity being evaluated. Accordingly, in Python, classes, by the way, can both implement and provide an interface.\nIn fact, the implementation declaration (IVehicle) is a convention; just a promise that a given class and its objects behave that way. No real checks will be made.\nclass IVehicle (zope.interface.Interface): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Any moving thing\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; speed = zope.interface.Attribute(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Movement speed\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) def move(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Make a single step\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; class Car(object): zope.interface.implements(IVehicle) assert IVehicle.implementedBy(Car) assert IVehicle.providedBy(Car()) The component architecture of Zope includes another important concept - adapters. Generally speaking, this is a simple design pattern that corrects one class for use somewhere where a different set of methods and attributes is required.\nAdapters Consider a simple an example from the Comprehensive Guide to Zope Component Architecture.\nSuppose there are a couple of classes, Guest and Desk. Let\u0026rsquo;s define interfaces to them, plus a class that implements the Guest interface:\nimport zope.interface from zope.interface import implements from zope.component import adapts, getGlobalSiteManager class IDesk(zope.interface.Interface): def register(): \u0026#34;Register a person\u0026#34; class IGuest(zope.interface.Interface): name = zope.interface.Attribute (\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Person`s name\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) class Guest (object): implements(IGuest) def __init __ (self, name): self.name = name The adapter must account for the anonymous guest by registering in the list of names:\nclass GuestToDeskAdapter (object): adapts(IGuest) implements(IDesk) def __init __ (self, guest): self.guest = guest def register (self): guest_name_db.append (self.guest.name) There is a registry that keeps track of adapters by interface. Thanks to it, you can get an adapter by passing an adaptable object to the call of the interface class. If the adapter is not registered, the second argument to the interface will be returned:\nguest = Guest (\u0026#34;Ivan\u0026#34;) adapter = IDesk (guest, alternate = None) print adapter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; None found gsm = getGlobalSiteManager () gsm.registerAdapter (GuestToDeskAdapter) adapter = IDesk (guest, alternate = \u0026#34;None found\u0026#34;) print adapter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; __ main __. GuestToDeskAdapter object at 0xb7beb64c\u0026gt; This infrastructure is useful for splitting code into components and linking them together.\nOne of the most striking examples of using this approach besides Zope itself is the Twisted network framework, where a fair amount of the architecture relies on zope.interfaces interfaces.\nConclusion Upon closer inspection, it turns out that interfaces and abstract base classes are two different things.\nAbstract classes basically hardcode the required front-end part. Checking an object against the interface of an abstract class is checked using the built-in isinstance function; class - issubclass. An abstract base class should be included in the hierarchy as a base class or mixin.\nThe downside is the semantics of checks issubclass, isinstance, which intersect with ordinary classes (their inheritance hierarchy). No additional abstractions are built on the ABC.\nInterfaces are a declarative entity, they do not set any boundaries; simply asserts that the class implements and its object provides the interface. Semantically, the statements implementedBy, providedBy are more correct. On such a simple basis, it is convenient to build a component architecture using adapters and other derived entities, which is what the large Zope and Twisted frameworks do.\nIt should be understood that the use of both tools makes sense only when building and using relatively large OOP systems - frameworks and libraries, in small programs they can only confuse and complicate the code with unnecessary abstractions.\nHelp improve this content Please fix any typos or add more insights by editing this page.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  "

	"description": "New software based on deep learning algorithms automatically and accurately calculates LVEF",
	"content": " Bay Labs, a San Francisco-based medical technology company which focuses on using artificial intelligence to improve cardiovascular imaging, has released a new software EchoMD AutoEF. It is being claimed that this software will help to reduce the variability in cardiovascular imaging.\nThe software uses deep learning techniques to accurately calculate the left ventricular ejection fraction.\nWhat is Ejection Fraction? During each pumping cycle of our heart, it contracts and relaxes. When it contracts it passes the blood to ventricles. Ventricles are basically the pumping chambers. Ejection Fraction is the amount of blood withdrawn from the heart when it contracts. Medical professionals use EF to identify the health of a heart. They generally measure the EF from left ventricle because it is the main pumping chamber of the heart which passes the oxygenated blood through the ascending (upward) aorta to the rest of the body.\nMeasuring EF There are various methods available to measure LVEF, out of which Simpson’s biplane method is used widely. This method has about 9.2% average variability. The EchoMD AutoEF software by Bay Labs has an average variability of 8.2%. Moreover, EchoMD AutoEF doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any user intervention, it\u0026rsquo;s fully automatic. It calculates LVEF from complete echocardiographic patient studies, automatically.\nHow Deep Learning Helped? At present Human intervention is required to calculate LVEF. Medical professionals have to go through the recorded clips. They watch them carefully and pick the best ones then they manipulate them for quantification. This is a very time consuming and prone-to-error process (as it is done by humans). The deep learning algorithms helped in this case by totally eliminating the need to do all of the above manually. The training set included 4,000,000 images from about 9,000 patients.\nQuoting Richard Bae, who is the Director of the Echocardiography Laboratory at the Minneapolis Heart Institute:\n \u0026ldquo;Historically there have been challenges with variability and reproducibility in reporting of the ejection fraction, especially when the EF is not normal; our study showed that the EchoMD AutoEF algorithms can aid interpretation enormously and have less variability than cardiologists reported in the literature.”\n\u0026ldquo;By supporting fast, efficient and accurate AI-assisted echocardiogram analysis, the algorithms can allow physicians to focus on putting results into the context for the patient - guiding prognosis and course of management.”\n This is a great innovation in the medical field. It will help cardiologists in better decision making.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given [510(k) clearance](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfPMN/pmn.cfm) to this product. Which means that the device is safe and effective in automatically selecting clips and calculating LVEF.  "

	"content": " A group of 9 cloud engineers at Google has refused to work on a project called air-gap due to which Google may lose a deal worth $10 billion. Google needs air-gap if it has to do some sensitive work with government agencies involving sensitive data (obviously military implications there). So this group of 9 basically just said they weren\u0026rsquo;t gonna do it. About 10-12 employees have resigned so far as part of this work strike. Google spends a lot of time making sure their top talent is happy so that they stick around and don\u0026rsquo;t go to other companies, so Google just stood down on this one. Urs Hölzle, the senior VP of technical infrastructure at Google said that the feature would be postponed.\nOn the one hand this is good as it shows that employees get ample space to air grievances, but on the other hand, the shareholders will get angry as it hampers Google\u0026rsquo;s ability to compete. In order to get government contracts especially those which involves sensitive data and military require some certifications, which Google\u0026rsquo;s competitors like Microsoft and Amazon have but Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t. This air-gap feature was supposed to help Google with that but it seems it\u0026rsquo;ll be abandoned.\nWhat is air-gap? Microsoft and Amazon have set-up a service called Government Cloud (Azure Government and AWS GovCloud) where the sensitive government information can be stored. An important feature of this service is air-gap. It is a security measure which ensures that a secured computer network is physically isolated from unsecured networks. Therefore, instead of storing data from multiple sources in a single server/system you store it in a separate isolated hardware. This is helpful for the government if they want to know where their data reside (physically) so that they can wipe it immediately.\nAlthough the feature is not that difficult to implement, Google can form a new team to work on it but looking at the fate of Project Maven which got similar boycott, it\u0026rsquo;d be difficult for Google.\nBesides, U.S. Congress is accusing Google over the partnership with Huawei, a Chinese manufacturer which makes Android phones. They said  You were not with the Pentagon on an AI project but you\u0026rsquo;ll work with the Chinese handset manufacturer.\n That is a very difficult situation for Google and I think they are right now working on how to handle this.\nSource: Bloomberg\n"

For example a tree has base, scripts following schematics will also have a base and that base will be the root structure. Any modification has first have to pass from staging area to make its way to the root. If any of the dependency provide a schematic then it can automatically update your code whenever there are major changes.\nSo now if you run ng update @angular/common it will update the package and run any schematic available for this package.\nTo get more details on ng update usage, refer the official specification.\nng add This is another CLI command added in Angular 6. This will be helpful in adding new packages to your project. It downloads the packages (with their dependencies) using the package manager and installs them with the help of Schematics.\nng add @angular/material // Install and configure Angular Material ng add @ng-bootstrap/schematics // Add ng-bootstrap in your application  This area will flourish with increase in packages supporting ng add. Refer Material\u0026rsquo;s ng-add schematic to get an idea on how to write one for your application.\nReferencing Providers Before this update we used to reference services from module but with Angular 6 we will reference module from service.\nAngular Elements @angular/elements creates a custom element which acts as a bridge between Angular component interface and change detection functionality to the built-in DOM API. You can bootstrap Angular components with your application and they will be registered as Angular Elements. One of the benefits that you get from this is that it\u0026rsquo;ll dynamically insert HTML code holding Angular components after your application is compiled.\nAngular Material + CDK Components Below are some new components that have been added in Angular 6.\n Tree: It is based on datatable component and is best suited for representing hierarchical data. CDK contains the core tree directive (cdk-tree) whereas mat-tree comes with Material design style. See this presentation from ng conf 2018 to get more details on Material Trees.   Badge: This component can be used to display a small piece of information such as notification count on notification drawer, unread emails count over the email icon etc.   Bottom-Sheet: This component is mobile-centric which can be used to present a list of options for a particular action. It appears from the bottom of the viewport (with slide-up animation).   Overlay: @angular/cdk/overlay has been updated with a new positioning logic which helps in creating intelligent pop-ups that remain on the screen in all situations.   Starter Components With Angular 6 you get 3 new starter components after running ng add @angular/material. With this update in place, it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to create simple UI.\n Create a dashboard\nng generate @angular/material:material-dashboard --name=test-dashboard    Create side navigation\nng generate @angular/material:material-nav --name=test-nav    Create a datatable\nng generate @angular/material:material-table --name=test-table   Library Support Library support has been added in 6.0.0. You can easily create a library using below command. See details.\nng generate library \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;  CLI Workspaces CLI can now support workspaces with multiple projects. angular-cli.json has been renamed to angular.json. Each workspace can have multiple projects, each project can have targets and each target can have a configuration.\nRxJS v6 Angular 6 supports RxJS v6. RxJS v6 ensures that only those modules are bundled in production that are being used by your application. If you are moving from the previous version to Angular 6 then you have to change import statements and operator usage to make your application work. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to change then you can use this new package rxjs-compat which provides backward compatibility.\nLong Term Support Angular team announced to provide long-term support for all major releases starting from version 4. LTS will include 6 months of active development + 12 months of security patches and critical bug fixes.\nOther Changes:  \u0026lt;template\u0026gt; tag has been removed so now you have to use \u0026lt;ng-template\u0026gt; instead. - @angular/http is deprecated, @angular/common/http is the recommended alternative. If above-listed features look promising to you and you want to use Angular 6 for your existing project, then follow https://update.angular.io/.   "

	"description": "Popular Alternatives to GitHub for Web, Linux, Windows, Self-Hosted and more.",
	"content": " The trending news of yesterday was the acquisition of GitHub (the world\u0026rsquo;s leading software development platform) by Microsoft. This is a great deal for Microsoft which might put it in the position it was about 10 years ago in the software market. But a lot of open-source fans are unhappy with this.\nA couple of years ago Microsoft was anti-open-source.\n \u0026ldquo;Open source is an intellectual-property destroyer. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.\u0026rdquo; - Jim Allchin (Former Windows chief), 2001\n  \u0026ldquo;Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.\u0026rdquo; - Steve Ballmer (Former CEO)\n However, in recent years Microsoft has tried hard to catch up with the open-source world. They are promoting themselves as a supporter of open-source. They have open-sourced some of their projects and also joined The Linux Foundation as a platinum member.\nNobody knows whether they are doing this because they accepted that open-source is good or they are just trying to stay in the business by getting the attention of open-source users. Surely there are trust issues. Some GitHub users have already started looking for alternatives.\nBelow is a list of some popular services similar to GitHub:\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  1.

	"description": "What is the difference between list methods append and extend in Python?",
	"content": " append and extend are list methods in Python which can be used to combine multiple lists. But what is the difference between them? When should you use one over another, let\u0026rsquo;s find out.\nThe official documentation describes them as:\n list.append(x): Add an item to the end of the list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].\n list.extend(L): Extend the list by appending all the items in the given list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = L.\n  Notice the bold words in the definition. append adds an item and extend appends all the items of the given list.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example:\nappend a list to another list in Python some_list = [\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5] another_list = [\u0026#39;new data\u0026#39;, 12] some_list.append(another_list) print some_list Output:\n[\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5, [\u0026#39;new data\u0026#39;, 12]] As you can see, the append method took an item i.e. the object of another list and added it to some_list as it is.\nextend a list with another list in Python some_list = [\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5] another_list = [\u0026#39;new data\u0026#39;, 12] some_list.extend(another_list) print some_list Output:\n[\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5, \u0026#39;new data\u0026#39;, 12] In case of extend you can see that all the items from another_list were appended to some_list one by one. So you can say extend method concatenates one list with another list.\nQuiz Q: What will be the output of below code:\nsome_list = [\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5] data = \u0026#39;hello\u0026#39; some_list.extend(data) print some_list A: Output is\n[\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5, \u0026#39;h\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;e\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;o\u0026#39;] Explanation: If you notice carefully, data is a string and strings in Python are iterable. Therefore the extend method iterated over all characters in the string one by one and appended them to the list.\nSo based on above we can say that below 2 code snippets are equivalent:\nfor data in iterator: some_list.append(data)some_list.extend(iterator)"

	"content": " I\u0026rsquo;m sure you must be aware about the importance of configuration files. Config files help creating the initial settings for any project, they help avoiding the hardcoded data.\nImagine if you migrate your server to a new host and suddenly your application stops working, now you have to go through your code and search/replace IP address of host at all the places. Config file comes to the rescue in such situation. You define the IP address key in config file and use it throughout your code. Later when you want to change any attribute, just change it in the config file. So helpful, isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see how can we create and read config files in Python.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  Creating config file in Python In Python we have configparser module which can help us with creation of config files (.ini format).\nfrom configparser import ConfigParser #Get the configparser object config_object = ConfigParser() #Assume we need 2 sections in the config file, let\u0026#39;s call them USERINFO and SERVERCONFIG config_object[\u0026#34;USERINFO\u0026#34;] = { \u0026#34;admin\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Chankey Pathak\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;loginid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;chankeypathak\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tutswiki\u0026#34; } config_object[\u0026#34;SERVERCONFIG\u0026#34;] = { \u0026#34;host\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;tutswiki.com\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;port\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8080\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;ipaddr\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;8.8.8.8\u0026#34; } #Write the above sections to config.ini file with open(\u0026#39;config.ini\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;) as conf: config_object.write(conf) Now if you check the working directory, you will notice config.ini file has been created, below is its content.\n[USERINFO] admin = Chankey Pathak password = tutswiki loginid = chankeypathak [SERVERCONFIG] host = tutswiki.com ipaddr = 8.8.8.8 port = 8080 Reading a key from config file So we have created a config file, now in your code you have to read the configuration data so that you can use it by \u0026ldquo;keyname\u0026rdquo; to avoid hardcoded data, let\u0026rsquo;s see how to do that.\nfrom configparser import ConfigParser #Read config.ini file config_object = ConfigParser() config_object.read(\u0026#34;config.ini\u0026#34;) #Get the password userinfo = config_object[\u0026#34;USERINFO\u0026#34;] print \u0026#34;Password is {}\u0026#34;.format(userinfo[\u0026#34;password\u0026#34;]) Output:\nPassword is tutswiki Updating a key in config file Suppose you have updated the password for chankeypathak user.

Firstly, we can get the weekday from the index. We haven\u0026rsquo;t talked about indexes yet, but the index is what\u0026rsquo;s on the left on the above dataframe, under \u0026lsquo;Date\u0026rsquo;.

I found out that 0 was Monday by checking on a calendar.\nNow that we know how to get the weekday, we can add it as a column in our dataframe like this:\nberri_bikes.loc[:,\u0026#39;weekday\u0026#39;] = berri_bikes.index.weekday berri_bikes[:5] Output:\n  Berri 1 weekday   Date       2012-01-01  35  6   2012-01-02  83  0   2012-01-03  135  1   2012-01-04  144  2   2012-01-05  197  3      4.2 Adding up the cyclists by weekday This turns out to be really easy! Dataframes have a .groupby() method that is similar to SQL groupby, if you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with that. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to explain more about it right now \u0026ndash; if you want to to know more, the documentation is really good.\nIn this case, berri_bikes.groupby('weekday').aggregate(sum) means\n \u0026ldquo;Group the rows by weekday and then add up all the values with the same weekday.\u0026rdquo;\n weekday_counts = berri_bikes.groupby(\u0026#39;weekday\u0026#39;).aggregate(sum) weekday_counts Output:\n  Berri 1   weekday      0  134298   1  135305   2  152972   3  160131   4  141771   5  101578   6  99310      It\u0026rsquo;s hard to remember what 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 mean, so we can fix it up and graph it:\nweekday_counts.index = [\u0026#39;Monday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Tuesday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Wednesday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Thursday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Friday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Saturday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Sunday\u0026#39;] weekday_counts Output:\n  Berri 1     Monday  134298   Tuesday  135305   Wednesday  152972   Thursday  160131   Friday  141771   Saturday  101578   Sunday  99310      weekday_counts.plot(kind=\u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;) Output:\n  So it looks like Montrealers are commuter cyclists \u0026ndash; they bike much more during the week. Neat!\n4.3 Putting it together Let\u0026rsquo;s put all that together, to prove how easy it is. 6 lines of magical pandas! If you want to play around, try changing sum to max, numpy.median, or any other function you like.\nbikes = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;../data/bikes.csv\u0026#39;, sep=\u0026#39;;\u0026#39;, encoding=\u0026#39;latin1\u0026#39;, parse_dates=[\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;], dayfirst=True, index_col=\u0026#39;Date\u0026#39;) # Add the weekday column berri_bikes = bikes[[\u0026#39;Berri 1\u0026#39;]].copy() berri_bikes.loc[:,\u0026#39;weekday\u0026#39;] = berri_bikes.index.weekday # Add up the number of cyclists by weekday, and plot! weekday_counts = berri_bikes.groupby(\u0026#39;weekday\u0026#39;).aggregate(sum) weekday_counts.index = [\u0026#39;Monday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Tuesday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Wednesday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Thursday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Friday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Saturday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Sunday\u0026#39;] weekday_counts.plot(kind=\u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;) Output:\n  "

So I went to the site for Canadian historical weather data, and figured out how to get it automatically.\nHere we\u0026rsquo;re going to get the data for March 2012, and clean it up\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an URL template you can use to get data in Montreal.\nurl_template = \u0026#34;http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/bulk_data_e.html?format=csv\u0026amp;stationID=5415\u0026amp;Year={year}\u0026amp;Month={month}\u0026amp;timeframe=1\u0026amp;submit=Download+Data\u0026#34; To get the data for March 2013, we need to format it with month=3, year=2012.\nurl = url_template.format(month=3, year=2012) weather_mar2012 = pd.read_csv(url, index_col=\u0026#39;Date/Time\u0026#39;, parse_dates=True) This is super great! We can just use the same read_csv function as before, and just give it a URL as a filename. Awesome.\nThere are 16 rows of metadata at the top of this CSV, but pandas knows CSVs are weird, so there\u0026rsquo;s a skiprows options. We parse the dates again, and set \u0026lsquo;Date/Time\u0026rsquo; to be the index column. Here\u0026rsquo;s the resulting dataframe.\nweather_mar2012 Output:\n  Year Month Day Time Data Quality Temp (Â°C) Temp Flag Dew Point Temp (Â°C) Dew Point Temp Flag Rel Hum (%) ...

We\u0026rsquo;re going to look at a few columns here. I know already that there are some problems with the zip code, so let\u0026rsquo;s look at that first.\nTo get a sense for whether a column has problems, I usually use .unique() to look at all its values. If it\u0026rsquo;s a numeric column, I\u0026rsquo;ll instead plot a histogram to get a sense of the distribution.\nWhen we look at the unique values in \u0026ldquo;Incident Zip\u0026rdquo;, it quickly becomes clear that this is a mess.\nSome of the problems:\n Some have been parsed as strings, and some as floats There are nans Some of the zip codes are 29616-0759 or 83 There are some N/A values that pandas didn\u0026rsquo;t recognize, like \u0026lsquo;N/A\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;NO CLUE\u0026rsquo;  What we can do:\n Normalize \u0026lsquo;N/A\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;NO CLUE\u0026rsquo; into regular nan values Look at what\u0026rsquo;s up with the 83, and decide what to do Make everything strings\nrequests[\u0026#39;Incident Zip\u0026#39;].unique()

	"description": "Parsing Unix timestamps",
	"content": " 8.1 Parsing Unix timestamps It\u0026rsquo;s not obvious how to deal with Unix timestamps in pandas \u0026ndash; it took me quite a while to figure this out. The file we\u0026rsquo;re using here is a popularity-contest file I found on my system at /var/log/popularity-contest.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an explanation of how this file works.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to hope that nothing in it is sensitive :)\nimport pandas as pd # Read it, and remove the last row popcon = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;popularity-contest\u0026#39;, sep=\u0026#39; \u0026#39;, )[:-1] popcon.columns = [\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;package-name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mru-program\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tag\u0026#39;] popcon[:5] The colums are the access time, created time, package name, recently used program, and a tag\nOutput:\n  atime ctime package-name mru-program tag     0  1387295797  1367633260  perl-base  /usr/bin/perl  NaN   1  1387295796  1354370480  login  /bin/su  NaN   2  1387295743  1354341275  libtalloc2  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtalloc.so.2.0.7  NaN   3  1387295743  1387224204  libwbclient0  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwbclient.so.0  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   4  1387295742  1354341253  libselinux1  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1  NaN      The magical part about parsing timestamps in pandas is that numpy datetimes are already stored as Unix timestamps. So all we need to do is tell pandas that these integers are actually datetimes \u0026ndash; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to do any conversion at all.\nWe need to convert these to ints to start:\npopcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;] = popcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;].astype(int) popcon[\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;] = popcon[\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;].astype(int) Every numpy array and pandas series has a dtype \u0026ndash; this is usually int64, float64, or object. Some of the time types available are datetime64[s], datetime64[ms], and datetime64[us]. There are also timedelta types, similarly.\nWe can use the pd.to_datetime function to convert our integer timestamps into datetimes. This is a constant-time operation \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;re not actually changing any of the data, just how pandas thinks about it.\npopcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;] = pd.to_datetime(popcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;], unit=\u0026#39;s\u0026#39;) popcon[\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;] = pd.to_datetime(popcon[\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;], unit=\u0026#39;s\u0026#39;) popcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;].dtype Output:\ndtype(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;M8[ns]\u0026#39;) If we look at the dtype now, it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lt;M8[ns]. As far as I can tell M8 is secret code for datetime64.\nSo now we can look at our atime and ctime as dates!\npopcon[:5] Output:\n  atime ctime package-name mru-program tag     0 2013-12-17 15:56:37 2013-05-04 02:07:40  perl-base  /usr/bin/perl  NaN   1 2013-12-17 15:56:36 2012-12-01 14:01:20  login  /bin/su  NaN   2 2013-12-17 15:55:43 2012-12-01 05:54:35  libtalloc2  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtalloc.so.2.0.7  NaN   3 2013-12-17 15:55:43 2013-12-16 20:03:24  libwbclient0  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwbclient.so.0  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   4 2013-12-17 15:55:42 2012-12-01 05:54:13  libselinux1  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1  NaN      Now suppose we want to look at all packages that aren\u0026rsquo;t libraries.\nFirst, I want to get rid of everything with timestamp 0. Notice how we can just use a string in this comparison, even though it\u0026rsquo;s actually a timestamp on the inside? That is because pandas is amazing.\npopcon = popcon[popcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;] \u0026gt; \u0026#39;1970-01-01\u0026#39;] Now we can use pandas\u0026rsquo; magical string abilities to just look at rows where the package name doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain \u0026lsquo;lib\u0026rsquo;.\nnonlibraries = popcon[~popcon[\u0026#39;package-name\u0026#39;].str.contains(\u0026#39;lib\u0026#39;)] nonlibraries.sort(\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;, ascending=False)[:10] Output:\n  atime ctime package-name mru-program tag     57  2013-12-17 04:55:39 2013-12-17 04:55:42  ddd  /usr/bin/ddd  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   450 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:05:13  nodejs  /usr/bin/npm  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   454 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:05:04  switchboard-plug-keyboard  /usr/lib/plugs/pantheon/keyboard/options.txt  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   445 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:05:04  thunderbird-locale-en  /usr/lib/thunderbird-addons/extensions/langpac...  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   396 2013-12-16 20:08:27 2013-12-16 20:05:03  software-center  /usr/sbin/update-software-center  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   449 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:05:00  samba-common-bin  /usr/bin/net.samba3  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   397 2013-12-16 20:08:25 2013-12-16 20:04:59  postgresql-client-9.1  /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/psql  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   398 2013-12-16 20:08:23 2013-12-16 20:04:58  postgresql-9.1  /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/postmaster  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   452 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:04:55  php5-dev  /usr/include/php5/main/snprintf.h  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   440 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:04:54  php-pear  /usr/share/php/XML/Util.php  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;      Okay, cool, it says that I I installed ddd recently. And postgresql! I remember installing those things. Neat.\nThe whole message here is that if you have a timestamp in seconds or milliseconds or nanoseconds, then you can just \u0026ldquo;cast\u0026rdquo; it to a datetime64[the-right-thing] and pandas/numpy will take care of the rest.\nWhere from here? This was an attempt to provide concise cookbook with real life examples. We suggest you to have a look at the official cookbook also.\n"
