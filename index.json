A class is a blueprint of objects whereas an object is an instance of a class.","content":" Objects Java is an object-oriented language meaning it follows the object-oriented programming (OOPS) paradigm. The OOPS principle looks at any problem as an interaction between various objects. This, in turn, helps us to solve real-world problems easily because most of it involves objects. Objects are described by their intrinsic properties ( in coding terms some base data ) and how they can interact within the object and also with other objects ( in coding terms some functionality over the data ). So it is natural to organize objects into a composition of data and functionality.\nFor example: Let us look at a car and a petrol pump. We could probably limit ourselves and say that Color, Fuel and Speed describe a car completely and Fuel and Color describe a petrol pump completely. So these become our data. Now suppose if the driver wants to fuel the car, this represents an object interaction problem between a petrol pump and the car, where the fuel attribute of the car must increase and that of the petrol pump must decrease. Hence we can introduce functionality fill tank in the car to interact with the petrol pump and transfer fuel from the pump to the car. From this, we can see that it would be much easier for the functionality to access the data if they were composed together.\nClasses Now that we have a basic understanding of why OOPS is helpful, let us see what happens if we need to manufacture a new car. Do we start everything from scratch? Most of the car manufacturing companies follow a blueprint when producing a car so that they need not invest time again and again to design the properties and functionalities of the car. This is the same in OOPS as well. We use something called a Class to define our blueprint for an object so that if we want to create another object of the same kind we can use this blueprint to speed up our process.\nClasses and Objects in Java At the enterprise level, where we need to model real-time situations the use of OOPS principles is extremely important. In Java, we store the data of an object in a data member/field of the object and the functionality of objects are defined as methods of the object. We define a class in Java to tell the compiler about the blueprint of the object we need. The class also contains the definitions of the data members and the required methods. The compiler can use this information to allocate resources like memory when an object is created using this blueprint.\nExample Let us model the car and petrol pump using classes and create objects using the classes.\nclass petrolPump { int Fuel; String Color; public petrolPump(int Fuel) { this.Fuel = Fuel; } } Public class Car { int Fuel; int Speed; String Color; public Car(int Fuel) { this.Fuel = Fuel; } public void fillTank(int requiredFuel, petrolPump pump) { if (pump.Fuel \u0026gt;= requiredFuel) { pump.Fuel -= requiredFuel; this.Fuel += requiredFuel; } } public static void main(String[] args) { Car myCar = new Car(10); petrolPump pump = new petrolPump(1000); myCar.fillTank(50, pump); } } There might be several doubts in this code especially if you are new to OOPS, let us answer them one by one.\nVariables and Methods The data members of the class are also called as the instance variables. These are the variables that are declared in the class before the methods. These variables are instantiated during object creation by the constructor, which we will discuss soon. These variables have a class scope, that is they exist as long as the object of the class exists and is destroyed once the object is destroyed. They are also bound to a single object of the class and can be accessed directly or indirectly via the object, bound to access rules of the variable.\nWe can also have local variables to help us in some processing inside the methods. They have local scope to the methods and die once the method execution is finished. These are not accessible by the objects of the class and do not describe the object. The functions written within the scope of the class are called as class methods. They have direct access to the instance variables of the class and can manipulate them to change the state of the object. The functions are in general not bound to a single object of the class, but rather all objects of the class share a copy during the run time of the program. They can be accessed directly or indirectly via the object, bound to access rules of the method.\nAccessing variables and methods We use the . operator in Java to access methods or variables of the class via its objects. This is bound to access rules. If the access for the variable or method is public then we can use the operator to directly access the variable/method. In the given code myCar.fillTank( 50, pump ); uses the operator.\nthis keyword this keyword is used to specify the current object. To access the instance variables, we can use this keyword with the . operator. It tells the compiler that the variable being referred to is the instance variable associated with the current object which is executing the method.\nObject Creation The line Car myCar = new Car(10); creates a new Car object out of the Car class blueprint and initialises it or we can say myCar is an object of the type Car. During object creation, when we use the above syntax, it instructs the compiler to create a new object of the class Car by calling a special method which is called as the Constructor of the class. The constructor of the class is a function which has no return type, needs to have the same name as that of the class and is invoked when an object of the class is created. The main purpose of this is to instantiate the data members of the object. A constructor can be parameterized such that we can pass parameters to it to instantiate the data members with specific values rather than default ones.\nBelow is an example of parametrized vs non-parameterized constructor. If we do not declare this method in the class, the compiler automatically assigns a non-parameterized constructor to the class. Constructors can also be overloaded according to Java principles. We will learn more about Constructors in the next section.\n//parameterised public Car(int Fuel) { this.Fuel = Fuel; } //Non-paramterised public Car() { this.Fuel = 0; }"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/java/constructors/","title":"Constructors","tags":["Java"],"description":"A constructor initializes an object when it is created. In Java, we use the new keyword to initialize an object whose class/type is not of the primitive types.","content":" Object Initialization We know that in Java classes are blueprints and objects are the actual entities created by following the design of the blueprint. To create an object we need to initialize it or in simpler terms assign resources like memory, initialize instance variables, load methods, etc. If we don\u0026rsquo;t do this Java assigns the object a null value on the declaration of the object. In Java, we use the new keyword to initialize an object whose class/type is not of the primitive types. The primitive types are a special case and are not mapped to null values on their declaration. They are assigned the following default values:\n   Type Default Value     boolean false   byte (byte) 0   short (short) 0   int 0   long 0L   char \\u0000   float 0.0f   double 0.0d    public class square { int perimeter; public square() { this.perimeter = 10; } public static void main(String[] args) { Square square_1; // null object  square_1 = new square(); // square object  } } In the above code, the initial declaration of square creates a null object but after using the new keyword and initializing it, it gets converted into a square object, and then we can treat it like a square object and use its member fields and functions.\nWhere does object initialization start? The whole process of starting up the initialization happens in the constructor of the class. The constructor is similar to member functions of the class but not completely. When the compiler enters the constructor all the resource allocation for that object happens in the background and its instance variables are given default values if they are of primitive type or a null value if otherwise. Also, we can use the constructor to initialize the instance variables of the class for that object explicitly. In this way, the constructor completely initializes the object.\nConstructors As mentioned above constructors can be considered as special methods which have the following properties:\n No return type Are called implicitly during object creation Generally have public access (With some exception which we will discuss in later section) Have the same name as that of the class Are not members of the class and hence cannot be inherited  There are different types of constructors. Let\u0026rsquo;s see them one by one.\nNon Parameterized Constructor It is an explicit constructor which is declared in the class and does not have any parameters passed to it. It is used to initialize the data members with default values. The code above illustrates a non parameterized constructor.\nParameterized Constructor It is an explicit constructor that is declared in the class and has parameters passed to it. It is used to initialize the data members with a particular set of given values.\npublic class square { int perimeter; public square(int val) { this.perimeter = val; } public static void main(String[] args) { Square square_1; // null object  square_1 = new square(1); // square object  } } The code above illustrates a non parameterized constructor.\nCopy Constructor It is a subtype of parameterized constructors. Say we are initializing an object O1. Here in the parameters, we pass an already initialized object, say O2 of the same class to the constructor during the initialization of O1. The required data members associated with O2 are copied into the respective data members of O1. The copy constructor cannot exist by itself. It requires either a traditional parameterized or non-parametrized constructor to be written along with it. This is an example of constructor overloading.\npublic class square{ int perimeter; public square(int val) { this.perimeter=val; } public square(square s1) { this.perimeter=s1.perimeter; } public static void main(String []args) { Square square_1; Square square_2; square_1=new square(1); square_2=new square(square_1); } } Here when square_2 is called, the overloaded copy constructor is called.\nDefault Constructor If none of the above constructors is declared by the programmer, then Java provides an inbuilt constructor that is implicit and assigns the data members with default values as seen in the table under Object Initialization.\nCalling one constructor from another It is possible to access another constructor of the same class from an overloaded constructor of the same class. This is achieved by using this keyword.\npublic class square { int perimeter; int sides; public square() { sides = 4; } public square(this.val) { this(); this.perimeter = val; } public static void main(String[] args) { Square square_1; Square square_2; square_1 = new square(1); square_2 = new square(square_1); } } For example, in the above code, the parameterized constructor is calling the non-parameterized one.\nInheritance and Constructor As constructors are not inherited, to access parent class constructors we use super keyword. Hence to access the constructor of the parent class, we have to call it explicitly by using the super keyword if the parent class has a parameterized constructor else the non-parameterized constructor or the default constructor for the parent class is called by default.\nThe below code illustrates this behaviour.\npublic class shape { String color; public shape(String color) { this.color = color; } } public class square extends shape { int perimeter; public square(int val, String color) { super(color) this.perimeter = val; } }"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/data_structures_algorithms/","title":"DSA","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Data Structure and Algorithms Introduction A complete guide to Data Structure and Algorithms.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/java/","title":"Java","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Java Introduction A complete guide to Java programming language.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/python/","title":"Python","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Python Introduction A complete guide to Python programming language.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/java/exceptions/","title":"Exceptions in Java","tags":["Java"],"description":"An exception in Java is defined as an unwanted or unexpected event. Object, Throwable, Exception, Error.","content":" Exceptions An exception in java is defined as an unwanted or unexpected event, which arises at the time of execution of a program i.e. at run time which disturbs the normal flow or working of our program.\nFor better understanding, consider the following scenario where you have planned to watch a movie in a nearby theater and you got ready and departed from your house but in the mid-way, your vehicle got punctured and for reaching your destination you took a taxi. What happened here is that your normal work or normal flow got disturbed due to an unexpected event (here puncture). This unexpected event may occur in a program too and there it is called exceptions. To handle these unwanted events, we use the concept of exception handling i.e. finding an alternate way to maintain the normal flow like taking a taxi in the above scenario.\nObserve the below code. The code will execute flawlessly until the value of i is less than zero. As soon as the value of i becomes zero then in the print statement, the value of n/i will be 6\u0026frasl;0 which is mathematically not correct and is an exception. Hence the compiler will give an error and all the code written after the point of exception will not get executed.\nExample class test { public static void main(String[] args) { int n = 6; for (int i = 3; i \u0026gt;= 0; i--) { System.out.println(n / i); } } } Output:\n2 3 6 Arithmetic Exception (divide by zero) Exception Hierarchy graph TD; java.lang--Object; Object--Throwable; Throwable--Exceptions; Throwable--Errors; Exceptions--Runtime; Exceptions--Other;  From the above figure, we can say that throwable class is the parent class of error, and exception class and object is the parent class of the throwable class.\nError  It occurs because of a lack of system resources e.g. the hard drive is full etc. Errors are not recoverable by programmers Errors are only of one type i.e. runtime exceptions or unchecked exceptions Error has the sub class as StackOverflowError, VirtualMachineError, OutOfMemoryError  Exception  Programs are the root cause of exceptions Exceptions can be recovered or fixed by a programmer using techniques provided by Java Exceptions are of two types  Compile-time exceptions or Checked exceptions Runtime exceptions or Unchecked exceptions.   There are many inbuilt types of exceptions class provided by Java. Some of them are as follows:\n IOException: When the user is operating on input-output commands and if any exception arises at that time then IOException is thrown. RuntimeException: If any unwanted event arises at the time of execution of the code or at runtime then RuntimeException is thrown. It has further sub classes as  ArithmeticException NullPointerException NumberFormatException IndexOutOfBoundException   Checked Exception This type of exception is also known as compile-time exception. These exceptions can be checked at compile time. The compiler will show a warning at compile time when a program containing such exceptions are compiled. It includes classes like IOException, SQLExcpetion etc.\nExample import java.io.FileInputStream; class test { public static void main(String[] args) { FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\u0026#34;d:/a.txt\u0026#34;); } } Output: Error: unreported exception FileNotFoundException. Must be caught or declared to be thrown\nThe above code will give you a warning at compile time that file not found, exception may arrive in future and you must handle that exception.\nUnchecked Exception These types of exceptions are also acknowledged as runtime exceptions. These exceptions can\u0026rsquo;t be checked and ignored by the compiler at compile time. Examples include ArithmetcException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException etc.\nExample class test { public static void main(String[] args) { int x = 10, y = 0, z; Z = x / y; System.out.println(c); } } Output: ArithmeticException: divide by zero\nThe compiler will not give any warning at the compilation time and the program will get compiled successfully. But at the runtime, it will give us an error. Hence these exceptions are ignored by the compiler and they remain unchecked.\nNow we have learned about exceptions and its type, in the next section we will learn about how to handle these exceptions.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/pandas-cookbook/","title":"Pandas Cookbook","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Pandas Cookbook Introduction A newbie friendly introduction to Pandas with real life examples.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/java/exceptions/exception-handling/","title":"Exception Handling","tags":["Java"],"description":"Exception handling is the facility provided by Java to handle all the unwanted event or exception that arises in our program to maintain the normal flow of our code. try,catch,throw,finally","content":" Exception handling is the facility provided by Java to handle all the unwanted event or exception that arises in our program to maintain the normal flow of our code. Whenever there is an exception, the method in which the exception occurs will create an object and that object will store three things:\n Exception name: It stores the class name which can handle the occurred exception. Description: It describes what type of exception has occurred. Stack trace: Stores the information about the line at which exception occurred or in which method the exception occurred.  graph TD; Object--JVM; JVM--id1[Default Exception Handler]; JVM--id2[Manual Handler];  Observe the above figure. As soon as the object is created, that object is passed to Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and now JVM checks whether the exception is handled by the user or not. If it is not handled then JVM passes the control to Default Exception Handler which will print the exception and our program is terminated abnormally.\nAn exception can be handled manually by the programmer using five keywords\n try catch finally throw throws  Try and Catch Syntax try { //code which can cause exception } catch(ExceptionClassName ref.var.name) { //handling code } After every try, there should be a catch block. Using try and catch block, we can be assured that our program will not terminate abnormally as it was terminating earlier without try and catch block.\nExample class test { public static void main(String[] args) { try { int x = 10, y = 0, z; Z = x / y; } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(e); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;hi\u0026#34;); } } Output:\nArithmeticException: divide by zero hi  When you will compile the above code, it will easily get compiled without any warning and will display the exception that has occurred and it will also print hi which shows that our program has not terminated abnormally.\nFlow of try and catch Example class test { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(“hi”); try { System.out.println(\u0026#34;welcome\u0026#34;); int x = 10, y = 2, z; Z = x / y; System.out.println(\u0026#34;to\u0026#34;); } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Tuts\u0026#34;); System.out.println(e); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Wiki\u0026#34;); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); } } Output:\nhi welcome to hello In the above code, the control is first at the print statement present just before try keyword which prints hi and then the control goes in try block. The first print statement prints welcome and the mathematical expression is evaluated. Since the denominator is non zero number, no exception arises and the control passes to the last print statement in try block which prints to. Since no exception occurred, the catch block didn’t get executed and the program terminated normally by printing hello.\nNow observe the below code to understand the flow when an exception arises.\nExample class test { public static void main(String[] args) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;hi\u0026#34;); try { System.out.println(\u0026#34;welcome\u0026#34;); int x = 10, y = 0, z; Z = x / y; System.out.println(\u0026#34;to\u0026#34;); } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;2\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Tuts\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Wiki\u0026#34;); System.out.println(e); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); } }hi welcome 2 Tuts Wiki ArithmeticException: divide by zero hello Now the value of the denominator in the try block is zero which will cause an exception. The control is first at print statement before try keyword which prints hi and then the control goes in try block. The first print statement prints welcome and the mathematical expression is evaluated. Since the denominator is zero, an exception arises and at once the control is passed to catch block. All the print statement in the catch block gets executed and the program gets terminated normally by printing hello. Note that after the execution of the catch block, control does not pass to try block back. Hence everything written below the occurrence of exception in try block will remain unexecuted.\nMultiple catch block We can have multiple catch blocks with a try block and the catch block which will come first will get the control first i.e. top to bottom approach.\nExample class test { public static void main(String[] args) { try { int x = 10, y = 0, z; Z = x / y; } catch(ArithmeticException e) { System.out.println(e); } catch(IndexOutOfBoundException e2) { System.out.println(e2); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;hi\u0026#34;); } }ArithmeticException: divide by zero hi  Order of catch block is very important because improper ordering may give you an error. The order of the catch block should be child class (ArithmeticException) to parent class (Exception), not the parent to the child class. For better understanding, consider below example-\nExample class test { public static void main(String[] args) { try { int x = 10, y = 0, z; } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;exception\u0026#34;); } catch(ArithmeticException e) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;ArithmeticException\u0026#34;); } } }Exception ArithmeticException has already been caught catch(ArithmeticException e) The compiler will give an error while compiling the above code. It will tell the user that the exception which has occurred has already been caught by the first catch block and there is no use to re-write the catch block which handles the same exceptions. Therefore, the order of catch block is important and should be from the child class to the parent class, not the parent to the child class.\nExample class test { public static void main(String[] args) { try { int x = 10, y = 0, z; } catch(ArithmeticException e) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Arithmeticexception\u0026#34;); } catch(Exception e) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Exception\u0026#34;); } } }Arithmeticexception The above code will execute properly without any error because the proper ordering of the catch block has been done. The first catch block says that if any arithmetic exception arises then it can handle it and if there is any other type of exception other than arithmetic exception then the second catch block will handle it.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/java/exceptions/exception-handling/throw-throws/","title":"throw and throws","tags":["Java"],"description":"The keyword throw is employed to throw an exception explicitly. It is mainly used to throw custom exceptions or user-defined exceptions.","content":" In the previous tutorial, we learned how to handle an exception using try and catch block. Now we will learn how exception handling is done using throw and throws keyword.\nthrow keyword The keyword throw is employed to throw an exception explicitly. It is mainly used to throw custom exceptions or user-defined exceptions. It is placed inside the method.\nSyntax throw new ExceptionClassName(\u0026#34;Message\u0026#34;); JVM or method does not make the exception object like it used to do before. Here the user has to explicitly make an object of the exception using the throw keyword.\nExample class test { public static void DivByZero() { throw new ArithmeticException(\u0026#34;Cannot divide by zero\u0026#34;); } public static void main(String[] args) { DivByZero(); } } Output:\nJava.lang.ArithmeticException: Cannot divide by zero We can also have a user-defined class of exceptions.

We note here that exception is still not handled because our program has terminated abnormally (because it did not print hello). To handle it, you have to use try and catch block.\nExample import java.util.Scanner; class AgeLimit extends RuntimeException { AgeLimit(String s) { super(s); } } class voting { public static void main(String[] args) { int age = 16; try { if (age \u0026lt; 18) { throw new AgeLimit(\u0026#34;you are not eligible for voting\u0026#34;); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;you can vote\u0026#34;); } } catch(Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } System.out.println(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); } Output:\nException in thread “main” AgeLimit:you are not eligible for voting. hello  Now the above code will not terminate abnormally because we have handled it using try and catch block. Remember that you cannot write any code below the throw keyword statement. If you do so then you will get a compiler error.\nthrows keyword throws keyword is used at the time of method declaration which indicates to the caller method that a particular type of exceptions may arrive if you are using this method and accordingly the caller method has to handle that exception. throws keyword is used only for checked exceptions.\nSyntax Method () throws Exception1 ,Exception2……Exception n For better understanding, consider the example given below\nExample import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.FileNotFoundException; { class files { void ReadFiles() throws FileNotFoundException { FileInputStream fi = new FileInputStream(\u0026#34;d:/xyz.txt\u0026#34;); } } class test { public static void main(string[] args) { try { ReadFiles(); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } System.out.println(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); } } Output:\nJava.io.FileNotFoundException: d:/xyz.txt hello  Now when the main function will call the ReadFiles method then the calling method i.e. main function will get informed that the function which you are calling will throw a FileNotFoundException and therefore the main function should handle it. If we would have not used the try-catch block then the compiler would have given us warning at compile time. Since we used the try-catch block, our code will get compiled easily and will not terminate abnormally (as we can confirm from hello message above).\nDifference between throw and throws    throw throws     It is used to create an exception object manually It is used to declare the exception.

It might happen sometime that finally block does not get executed. Some of the possible cases are - Using the method System.exit(0) - Using a fatal error that can cause the process to abort - If there is exception present in finally block itself - If the thread gets disturbed\nfinally block is also used for explicitly closing the resources such as connections, files, etc.\ntry with resources Unlike finally, try with resources automatically closes all the running resources which have been initiated by try and catch block.\nSyntax try (Resource declaration) { // code that uses the resource } catch(ExceptionType e1) { // catch block which handles all the exceptions } Example import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; public class test { public static void main(String args[]) { try (FileReader file = new FileReader(\u0026#34;d://xyz.txt\u0026#34;)) { int[] a = new int[10]; file.read(a); for (int c: a) System.out.println(c); } catch(IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } In the above code, the FileReader class automatically gets closed as the try and catch block gets executed. Some important points regarding try and resource statement\n Try with resources statements can declare multiple classes and these classes are closed in the reverse order i.e. bottom to up. A class should be of AutoCloseable type. Resources that have been declared in the try block are automatically considered as final by the compiler.  User defined exception You can also create customized exception class. If you want to create a checked exception, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to extend the Exception class, if you want to create the unchecked or runtime exception class then you\u0026rsquo;ll need to extend RuntimeException class.\nExample import java.util.Scanner; class AgeLimit extends RuntimeException { AgeLimit(String s) { super(s); } } class voting { public static void main(String[] args) { int age = 16; if (age \u0026lt; 18) { throw new AgeLimit(\u0026#34;you are not eligible for voting\u0026#34;); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;you can vote\u0026#34;); } } System.out.println(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); } Output:\nException in thread \u0026#34;main\u0026#34; AgeLimit:you are not eligible for voting.  Above is created an unchecked exception class by the user which extends the RuntimeException and its constructor prints the exception that occurs.\nNote With this, we have completed our tutorial of exception handling using five keywords i.e. try, catch, finally, throw and throws. Some important points which you need to know about the rules of the declaration of these five keywords are:\n There is no existence of a catch block without a try block There should be no code between try, catch, and finally block There is no existence of try block without either of the catch or finally block finally block is completely optional  "},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/java/exceptions/exception-handling/regex/","title":"Regular Expressions in Java","tags":["Java"],"description":"finally is the block that will always get executed irrespective of the fact whether the exception is handled or not.","content":" 1.1 Introduction Regular expression in simple terms is a special sequence of symbols and alphanumeric characters that defines a search pattern.\n1.2 Uses  These are used to describe what you are looking for when you search for data in text, article etc.\n Data Validation like checking if the user has inserted a valid e-mail address or not. Data Scraping/Web scraping like when you want to scrape particular data from the internet. These are also used in search engines, string processing etc.  Example ^[A-Za-z0-9+_.-]+@(.+)$ This pattern is used to validate email addresses.\n A-Z characters allowed. a-z characters allowed. 0-9 numbers allowed. Additionally, email may contain a dot, dash and underscore. Rest all characters are not allowed  2.1 RegExp in Java Java Regex is an API which is used for searching and manipulating strings from a given text which matches the pattern defined in the API.\n2.2 Java Regex Package Java provides the java.util.regex for pattern matching with regular expressions. This package consists of three main classes:\n Matcher Class Pattern Class PatternSyntaxException class  2.2.1 Matcher Class Matcher class interprets the pattern defined by pattern class and is used to perform matching functions on the given char sequence.\nSome functions in the matcher class are:\nboolean matches() Used to test whether the given string matches the given regex pattern or not.\nboolean find() Used to find the next string expression which matches the given regex pattern in the given text.\nboolean find(int start) Used to search the next expression which matches the given regex pattern from the given start number.\n2.2.2 Pattern Class It is the compiled form of regular expression which is used to define the pattern for a regex engine. One of the functions in Pattern class is:\nPattern.compile(String regex) Its job is to compile the given regex pattern and return the instance of a pattern.\n2.2.3 PatternSyntaxException Class It is used to find errors in regular expression patterns.\nExample import java.util.regex. * ; public class reg { Public static void main(String[] args) { String email = \u0026#34;abcd99@gmail.com\u0026#34;; String pat = \u0026#34; ^ [a - zA - Z0 - 9_ ! #$ % \u0026amp;\u0026#39;*+/=?`{|}~^.-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+$\u0026#34;; // Pattern for email validation with constraints  Pattern p = Pattern.compile(pat); // Pattern Object  Matcher m = p.matcher(email); // Matcher Object  System.out.println(m.matches()); // Prints true if the email is valid and false for invalid, here it will print true  } } 2.3 REGEX QUANTIFIERS Regex quantifiers are used in regular expressions to define how often an element can occur.\n * - occurrences should be zero or more times. + - occurrences should be one or more times. ? - occurrences should be zero or one time. {X} - occurrences should be X number of times {X,Y} - occurrences should be between X and Y number of times. {X,} - occurrences should be X or more than X.  2.4 REGEX CHARACTER CLASS Java Character Class has predefined sets which can be directly used as regex expressions.\n [xyz] - checks occurrence of x, y or z. [^xyz] - check the occurrence of any character other than x,y or z. [a-zA-Z] - check occurrence of characters from a-z or A-Z [a-z\u0026amp;\u0026amp;[xyz]] - check the occurrence of characters from a-z with x, y or z. [a-z\u0026amp;\u0026amp;[^xy]] - check occurrence of characters from a-z except x or y. [a-z\u0026amp;\u0026amp;[^m-p]] - check the occurrence of characters from a-z and not m through p.  Example import java.util.regex. * ; public class Reg { public static void main(String[] args) { Pattern p = Pattern.compile(\u0026#34;[abc]{3}\u0026#34;); Matcher m = p.matcher(\u0026#34;bcc\u0026#34;); Matcher ma = p.matcher(\u0026#34;acz\u0026#34;); System.out.println(m.matches()); System.out.println(ma.matches()); //Output - true \tfalse } } This program will only print true under the following conditions:\n String length is equal to 3. String only contains a b or c.  2.5 REGEX METACHARACTERS These characters have special meaning in computer programs and are used for making regular expressions.\n \\d - denotes you can enter any digit. It is a short form of [0-9]. \\D - denotes you can enter any non digit .It is short form [^0-9]. \\w - denotes you can enter any word character .It is short form of [a-zA-Z_0-9]. \\W - denotes you can enter any non-word character. It is short form of [^\\w]. \\b - denotes the word boundary. \\B - denotes a non-word boundary.  Example import java.util.regex. * ; public class Reg { public static void main(String[] args) { Pattern p = Pattern.compile(\u0026#34;\\\\D{3}\u0026#34;); Matcher m = p.matcher(\u0026#34;123\u0026#34;); Matcher ma = p.matcher(\u0026#34;aaa\u0026#34;); System.out.println(m.matches()); System.out.println(ma.matches()); //Output - false \ttrue } }"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/project-manager-must-have-skills/","title":"Top 4 Must Have Skills For A Project Manager","tags":[],"description":"Project Managers act as a link between the employer, who needs the project and employees, who work on the project.","content":"  According to studies conducted by PWC, 77% of the high performing companies realise the importance of project management but only 2.5% are able to complete all the projects. Despite having all team members on board, the low productivity rate has to be explained by the Project Manager, who couldn\u0026rsquo;t plan the right course of actions or overlooked the breakdown in communications.\n As simple and self-explanatory the term Project Manager sounds, his/her duty involves lots of multi-tasking and diversified knowledge in numerous areas.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s find out a few skills required by a successful Project Manager and understand his/her position in a team.\nCritical Thinking Yes. That\u0026rsquo;s the Number 1.\nAny activity or job requires pre-planned measures to avoid any end moment hustles or dead ends. A strategic course of action has to be laid down by the project manager to ensure the rapid development of the overall team. Thorough researches on the problem at hand and spotting possible future hurdles are expected to be done by the PMs. Arising technologies to make the process easier or having an eye for other projects laid on similar terms should also be the focus points.\nA project manager, like a critical thinker, must analyse the situation by answering the main 6 W questions\n What When Where Why Who How  While all other queries can be examined easily, recognising the factors of why and who is essential. The motive of the employer, the employee and the project should be clear to the project manager. This will ensure that an appropriate role is assigned to all the teammates and also timely highlight whether a member is to be added (or removed) to bridge the differences.\nTechnical Skills But aren\u0026rsquo;t they required just by the software engineers? The answer is no.\nBasic technological and system knowledge is a necessity in today\u0026rsquo;s world since most of the work involves the use of one software or another. If a project is completely software-based, like in case of web development, familiarity with technological tools being used will improve your communications with your team-mates so that you can examine the level project has reached and further improvise it. Project Managers even need to be acquainted with basic technical tools like Excel to maintain records of teammates\u0026rsquo; performance or track the documentation of the project(s).\nMany times, Project Managers need to discover innovative communication or interactive tools (like ClickUp or Wrike) to engage both with their clients and team members and make the tasks innovative. Knowledge of basic technical skills will overall help in managing the limited time frame effectively. Leadership Qualities Many workplaces are not able to incorporate this elementary yet indispensable technique.\nWhile control over your team is necessary, the thin line between a boss and a leader should never be crossed as a project manager. Communicating your ideas and in return listening to the ideas of your colleagues is important. A project manager should keep an unbiased opinion for the team members and help the team adapt to newly introduced logical ideas between the projects. A project manager must have a good rapport with his team and keep them motivated by resolving any issues faced during the project.\nLeadership skills are developed over time, with experience, and can not be instilled instantly. A person beginning with the position of Project Manager needs to build trust and faith with his teammates by keeping a cool-head and open mind. Contract Management The client or stakeholders demand the project assigned within a limited time frame and budget. The role of surveying all the business aspects of the project and calculating the risks involved (risk analysis) in its operations and executions rests upon the Project Manager.\nThe business analysis includes checking the scalability and viability of a project and transferring or allocating the required resources to the team members. Monitoring the budget at every step is beneficial since it limits the expenditure to the threshold of financial estimates. A defined set of operational and statistical metrics can play a functional role to support the project and stakeholders\u0026rsquo; decision making. Project manager\u0026rsquo;s negotiation skills or the ability to provide an alternative to solutions play a vital part in fixing the financial estimates. Verdict Project Managers act as a link between the employer, who needs the project and employees, who work on the project. That link needs to be strong but flexible enough to encompass the flow of information and resources from both sides and deliver a refined satisfactory outcome as the end product.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/setup-access-questdb-python-notebook/","title":"How to setup and access QuestDB using Python","tags":["Python"],"description":"Complete guide with examples on how to install QuestDB, create new database and query the same in python.","content":" Reasons to love QuestDB?

It\u0026rsquo;s been over 30 years since the World Wide Web was introduced to the world. Over time, the internet took its toll and now has roughly around 45 million web pages compared to 10,000 websites earlier. We really do have come a long way.\nEmerging from the primitive world of 2G signals we are now living in the era where mostly every device has an internet connection and if not of its own, gets one from another system. The technical term for sharing your phone’s internet connection to another phone or system is known as Tethering.\nTethering on Linux Tethering the internet through your phone to your Linux desktop can be done mainly via three simple ways.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check them out!\nUSB Tethering Connection over USB is just as simple as connecting your phone to a charger point. However, just like electricity is essential to charge your phone, internet connection in your phone is necessary to share it with others. Rare is the case when your charging cable is not suitable to be used as a data-transfer wire and you need to buy an apt one separately.\nThe connection is automatically established by plugging in your USB cable to both your computer and phone. A dialog box of confirmation highlighting the name of your device pops up.\nNow, Under the Settings in your phone select Wireless and Network (or Network and Internet). Click on the More tab and choose Tethering \u0026amp; Portable Hotspot and Enable USB Tethering. On the top right corner of your Linux machine, bring down the Network Connections toolbar as shown, where a tab Ethernet Connected is visible.\nYour system\u0026rsquo;s internet connection is ready!\nHowever, in a few cases you might have to further enable the Wired Settings window, where you can add a new connection and also view the IP address of your attached device. Here in this case, it is named Profile 1.\nClick on Profile 1\nWifi Tethering Following the same process as mentioned above, in your Android phone, open Settings and go to Network \u0026amp; Internet. Next, select Mobile Hotspot and Tethering and turn on the Mobile Hotspot. In your Linux system, again under the Network Connections, turn Wifi On\nand go to Wifi Settings.\nHere you can view all the available networks and connect with anyone by just entering the password available in your phone under Mobile Hotspot.\nThe Wi-Fi symbol in the top panel will now indicate that it\u0026rsquo;s connected.\nBluetooth Tethering Yes! The bluetooth connection can be used not only to transfer data files but for passing on your phone\u0026rsquo;s internet connection to your Linux machine. Navigating through the Network Connections tab, switch on the Bluetooth on your Linux distro and go to Bluetooth Settings.\nMake sure you have turned on Bluetooth in your phone too. Both of your devices will discover each other so click on the device\u0026rsquo;s name and a confirmation pin message will show up on both of the devices. If the pin matches, click confirm and Bluetooth pairing will be established.\nNow, again go to the Network Connections tab and under the paired device, here e9b7c69c, select the option to Connect to Internet.\nThe Bluetooth symbol in the top panel will now indicate that it\u0026rsquo;s connected.\nGo ahead and explore the unlimited boundaries of the internet on your Linux system! Thanks to the unimaginable scope of technology, without a doubt, your cellphone will always be at your rescue whenever a sudden need of an internet connection is required to your system.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/install-software-linux-yum-rpm-apt-dpkg/","title":"How to install software in Linux (RPM/DEB systems)","tags":["Linux"],"description":"In this tutorial we&#39;ll be covering packages, package managers and how to find, install and remove software for most popular Linux distributions. RPM/DEB based.","content":" In this tutorial, we\u0026rsquo;ll be covering packages, package managers and how to find, install and remove software for most popular Linux distributions.\nPackage Typically when you install software in a Linux system you do so with a package. A package is just a collection of files that make up an application. Additionally, a package contains data about the application as well as any steps required to successfully install and remove that application.\nData / Metadata The data or metadata that is contained within a package can include such information as the description of the application, the version and the list of dependencies or other packages that this particular application needs in order to function.\nPackage Manager A package manager is used to install, upgrade and remove packages. The package manager uses a package\u0026rsquo;s metadata to automatically install any required dependencies. Package managers keep track of what files belong to what packages, what packages are installed and what versions of those packages are installed.\nInstalling Software on RPM Distros Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of distributions that are based on the RPM package format. RPM stands for RedHat Package Manager.\n RedHat CentOS Fedora Oracle Linux Scientific Linux  yum The yum command-line utility is a package management program for those Linux distributions that use rpm packages.\nNote: Installing or removing software requires root or superuser privileges.\nFind packages to install using yum yum search string Display information about a package using yum yum info [package] Install a package with yum yum install [package] yum will typically ask you to review your request and say yes or no. If you want to continue to automatically answer yes to yum\u0026rsquo;s question use:\nyum install [-y] [package] Remove a package with yum yum remove [package] rpm In addition to the yum command, you can also use the rpm command to interact with the package manager.\nList installed packages using rpm rpm -qa List the file\u0026rsquo;s package usign rpm rpm -qf with path to a file will tell you what file a package belongs to.\nrpm -qf /path/to/file List package\u0026rsquo;s files List all the files that belong to that particular package\nrpm -ql [package] Install package using rpm rpm -ivh package.rpm Erase (uninstall) pacakge using rpm rpm -e [package]    (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  Installing Software on DEB Distros Another popular package format is the Debian package format. In addition to Debian, distributions like Mint and Ubuntu use deb packages.\n Debian Linux Mint Ubuntu  apt - Advanced Packacking Tool The Debian-based distributions use a package manager called apt (advanced packaging tool). apt is comprised of a few small utilities with the two most commonly used being apt-cache and apt-get.\nFind packages to install using apt-cache apt-cache search string Install a package with apt-get apt-get install [-y] [package] Remove a package but keep configurations apt-get remove [package] Remove a package and delete configurations apt-get purge [package] Display information about a package using apt-cache apt-cache show [package] dpkg In addition to the app utilities, you can use the dpkg command to interact with the package manager.\nList installed packages using dpkg dpkg -l List file\u0026rsquo;s package using dpkg dpkg -S /path/to/file List all files in a package using dpkg dpkg -L [package] Install a package with dpkg dpkg -i package.deb  Watch the video for live examples of searching, installing and removing some actual software like Dropbox using the above mentioned methods.\n   Summary Packages are used to install software on Linux system. You can manipulate packages with a package manager. Two of the most popular package formats are RPM and Debian. For RPM-based distributions use the yum and rpm commands to manage packages. For Debian-based distributions use apt and dpkg to manage packages.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/read-write-config-files-in-angular/","title":"Writing and Reading config files in Angular","tags":["angular"],"description":"Learn how to write and read config files in Angular using APP_INITIALIZER.","content":" Every app has some configurations to load.

No!\nSo let\u0026rsquo;s move to our actual solution which is:\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  APP_INITIALIZER Sounds awesome right? It will specify a factory and that will return a promise, the promise will load the config for the application. After loading the configs you can resolve the promise.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example.\nimport { APP_INITIALIZER } from \u0026#39;@angular/core\u0026#39;; function initialize() { return (): Promise\u0026lt;boolean\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; { return new Promise\u0026lt;boolean\u0026gt;((resolve: (a: boolean) =\u0026gt; void): void =\u0026gt; { resolve(true); }); }; @NgModule({ declarations: [ ], imports: [ ], providers: [{ provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: initialize, multi: true }], bootstrap: [] }) export class AppModule { }  useFactory will have the function which will return a function which will return a promise.\nmulti: true will allow to have multiple instances of the provider. They are all able to run simultaneously but the code will be stopped here until we get all the promises resolved.\nIn this code sample we have added APP_INITIALIZER to app.module.ts. It will call the initialize method. You can use this method to load configurations and initialize your app. As told above, this will return a promise. You can replace resolve(true) with your code or can write a new promise.\nHow to add dependencies in this method? To add dependencies, add a deps section in its provider. Example:\nproviders: [{ provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: initialize, deps: [ HttpClient, UserInfoService, ConfigService ], multi: true }],  and add them as parameter to our initialize method.\nfunction initialize(http: HttpClient, userInfoService: UserInfoService, config: ConfigService) { return (): Promise\u0026lt;boolean\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; { return new Promise\u0026lt;boolean\u0026gt;((resolve: (a: boolean) =\u0026gt; void): void =\u0026gt; { resolve(true); }); };  Reading config file in Angular First we will need a service to save the configs we are getting from config.json so let\u0026rsquo;s create a ConfigService.\nimport { Injectable } from \u0026#39;@angular/core\u0026#39;; @Injectable({ providedIn: \u0026#39;root\u0026#39; }) export class ConfigService { baseUrl: string; constructor() { } }  We have already added this in deps of APP_INITIALIZER.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s use initialize method to read our config file and set the necessary details for our app.\nfunction initialize(http: HttpClient, config: ConfigService): (() =\u0026gt; Promise\u0026lt;boolean\u0026gt;) { return (): Promise\u0026lt;boolean\u0026gt; =\u0026gt; { return new Promise\u0026lt;boolean\u0026gt;((resolve: (a: boolean) =\u0026gt; void): void =\u0026gt; { http.get(\u0026#39;./config.json\u0026#39;) .pipe( map((x: ConfigService) =\u0026gt; { config.baseUrl = x.baseUrl; resolve(true); }) ).subscribe(); }); }; }  And that\u0026rsquo;s how we deal with config in Angular.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/approximating-randomness/","title":"Approximating Randomness","tags":[],"description":"Generating random numbers from computers is essential to the development of certain kinds of software.

Anything from modelling the environment, to a lottery machine, to determining the value of loot in a chest in an RPG, will require random number generation. At first it may seem strange that computers, which are capable of producing massive amounts of digits in a short time, would not be able to produce random numbers. The difficulty is that the computers we use, are constructed specifically to follow logical steps deterministically, so to generate numbers that are truly random from a system like our computers is virtually impossible. True randomness cannot be obtained using arithmetic operations, which is exactly what our computers perform. When some sequence of numbers is random then it is not possible to predict what the next digit will be, and since computers use a set of logical steps to create any new number it is theoretically possible to predict it. Nonetheless programmers take advantage of features for creating random numbers all the time, the most widely used programming languages, provide libraries that can generate \u0026lsquo;random\u0026rsquo; values. Any role-playing game for example, that you might use, needs random values to determine the number of gold you\u0026rsquo;ll find from some locations, what items dead enemies will drop, etc. So how is it possible that even though the very nature of computers makes it impossible to exhibit random behaviour, that many programs include simulations of randomness?\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  The answer is pseudo-random number generators(PRNG), these are programs that follow a certain algorithm to simulate random behaviour. The numbers they generate, cannot be by definition truly random, however for many uses it is a good enough approximation. The libraries in many of todays programming languages that generate random digits use PRNG\u0026rsquo;s. The basic idea is to perform some arithmetic operations on a number in sequence, to make it seem like it\u0026rsquo;s random. A PRNG always starts with an initial value called a seed. It will then perform operations on the seed to make the final number different from the original value. So when the PRNG is supplied with seeds that are in sequence, it will return numbers that seem random, because the operations that are performed on each number should change it to make it so the returned numbers are no longer following any pattern. PRNG\u0026rsquo;s are also periodical, they have a certain amount of numbers they produce, and after that the sequence starts to repeat itself. It is usually not a problem to make the period very large, so that the application that relies on it will never start to get repeated sequences.\nA very well known PRNG is the Mersenne Twister(1), it is the default PRNG for Python, Ruby, PHP and many others. It has a period of 2^(19937−1), which is a Mersenne prime number, hence the name of the generator. Invented in 1997 it was largely superior to PRNG\u0026rsquo;s like C\u0026rsquo;s rand or Java\u0026rsquo;s Random. Furthermore it passes certain statistical tests for randomness so it is a very reliable generator as it is very successful at simulating genuine randomness.\nThese programs have been used extensively and are relied upon by many applications, it is important to note that when truly random behaviour is needed then PRNG\u0026rsquo;s are not sufficient. John von Neumann famously said:\n Anyone who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\n In this situation he was referring to depending on PRNG\u0026rsquo;s or other arithmetic approaches to create truly random digits, which is not a good idea. Rather it is possible to use true random number generators, that are based on the idea of extracting physical phenomena that are believed to be random and using them to generate random numbers. For example atmospheric noise, or radioactive decay, etc. Even though it is possible to extract truly random numbers from the outside world, most applications that use random numbers use PRNG\u0026rsquo;s. It is because of their convenience, there is no need for any extra devices, or input, all it needs is a sequence of numbers that it later transforms into a pseudo-random sequence.\n1: Link to the implementation of Mersenne Twister.

We don\u0026rsquo;t want to copy and paste the code. We want to leave the working code in one file and use it in multiple places. Often we want to combine elements from multiple files to create more sophisticated scripts.\nThe problem we have is that when we import a script it actually starts running. This is generally not what we expect when we import a script so that we can reuse it. How can we import the functions (or classes) from a file without having the script start doing something?\nGetting ready Let\u0026rsquo;s say that we have a handy implementation of the haversine distance function called haversine(), and it\u0026rsquo;s in a file named script.py.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  Initially, the file might look like this:\nimport csv import pathlib from math import radians, sin, cos, sqrt, asin from functools import partial MI= 3959 NM= 3440 KM= 6373 def haversine( lat_1: float, lon_1: float, lat_2: float, lon_2: float, *, R: float ) -\u0026gt; float: ... and more ... nm_haversine = partial(haversine, R=NM) source_path = pathlib.Path(\u0026#34;waypoints.csv\u0026#34;) with source_path.open() as source_file: reader= csv.DictReader(source_file) start = next(reader) for point in reader: d = nm_haversine( float(start[\u0026#39;lat\u0026#39;]), float(start[\u0026#39;lon\u0026#39;]), float(point[\u0026#39;lat\u0026#39;]), float(point[\u0026#39;lon\u0026#39;]) ) print(start, point, d) start= point  We\u0026rsquo;ve omitted the body of the haversine() function, showing only \u0026hellip; and more\u0026hellip;, since the full source is available on github. We\u0026rsquo;ve focused on the context in which the function is in a Python script that also opens a file, wapypoints.csv, and does some processing on that file.\nHow can we import this module without it printing a display of distances between waypoints in our waypoints.csv file?\nHow to do it\u0026hellip; Python scripts can be simple to write. Indeed, it\u0026rsquo;s often too simple to create a working script. Here\u0026rsquo;s how we transform a simple script into a reusable library:\n1) Identify the statements that do the work of the script: we\u0026rsquo;ll distinguish between definition and action. Statements such as import, def, and class are clearly definitional—they support the work but they don\u0026rsquo;t do the work. Almost all other statements take action. In our example, we have four assignment statements that are more definition than action. The distinction is entirely one of intent. All statements, by definition, take an action. These actions, though, are more like the action of the def statement than they are like the action of the with statement later in the script. Here are the generally definitional statements:\nMI= 3959 NM= 3440 KM= 6373 def haversine( lat_1: float, lon_1: float, lat_2: float, lon_2: float, *, R: float ) -\u0026gt; float: ... and more ... nm_haversine = partial(haversine, R=NM)  The rest of the statements clearly take an action toward producing the printed results.\n2) Wrap the actions into a function:\ndef analyze(): source_path = pathlib.Path(\u0026#34;waypoints.csv\u0026#34;) with source_path.open() as source_file: reader= csv.DictReader(source_file) start = next(reader) for point in reader: d = nm_haversine( float(start[\u0026#39;lat\u0026#39;]), float(start[\u0026#39;lon\u0026#39;]), float(point[\u0026#39;lat\u0026#39;]), float(point[\u0026#39;lon\u0026#39;]) ) print(start, point, d) start= point  3) Where possible, extract literals and make them into parameters. This is often a simple movement of the literal to a parameter with a default value. From this:\ndef analyze(): source_path = pathlib.Path(\u0026#34;waypoints.csv\u0026#34;)  To this:\ndef analyze(source_name=\u0026#34;waypoints.csv\u0026#34;): source_path = pathlib.Path(source_name)  4) Include the following as the only high-level action statements in the script file:\nif __name__ == \u0026#34;__main__\u0026#34;: analyze()  We\u0026rsquo;ve packaged the action of the script as a function. The top-level action script is now wrapped in an if statement so that it isn\u0026rsquo;t executed during import.\nHow it works\u0026hellip; The most important rule for Python is that an import of a module is essentially the same as running the module as a script. The statements in the file are executed in order from top to bottom.\nWhen we import a file, we\u0026rsquo;re generally interested in executing the def and class statements. We might be interested in some assignment statements.\nWhen Python runs a script, it sets a number of built-in special variables. One of these is __name__. This variable has two different values, depending on the context in which the file is being executed:\n The top-level script, executed from the command line: In this case, the value of the built-in special name of __name__ is set to __main__.\n A file being executed because of an import statement: In this case, the value of __name__ is the name of the module being created.\n  The standard name of __main__ may seem a little odd at first. Why not use the filename in all cases? This special name is assigned because a Python script can be read from one of many sources. It can be a file. Python can also be read from the stdin pipeline, or it can be provided on the Python command line using the -c option.\nWhen a file is being imported, however, the value of __name__ is set to the name of the module. It will not be __main__. In our example, the value __name__ during import processing will be script.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s more\u0026hellip; We can now build useful work around a reusable library. We might make several files that look like this:\nFile trip_1.py:\nfrom script import analyze analyze(\u0026#39;trip_1.csv\u0026#39;)  Or perhaps something even more complex:\nFile all_trips.py:\nfrom script import analyze for trip in \u0026#39;trip_1.csv\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;trip_2.csv\u0026#39;: analyze(trip)  The goal is to decompose a practical solution into two collections of features:\n The definition of classes and functions A very small action-oriented script that uses the definitions to do useful work  To get to this goal, we\u0026rsquo;ll often start with a script that conflates both sets of features. This kind of script can be viewed as a spike solution. Our spike solution should evolve towards a more refined solution as soon as we\u0026rsquo;re sure that it works.\nA spike or piton is a piece of removable mountain-climbing gear that doesn\u0026rsquo;t get us any higher on the route, but it enables us to climb safely.\nAlso see  How to run a Python module as script?

We can model these as functions of type A → List\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;. There is a natural way to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → List\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, and another function has type B → List\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → List\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;. The \u0026ldquo;composition\u0026rdquo; works by joining together all the intermediate lists of values into one. This is similar to MapReduce, which also collects together lists of results returned by individual workers.\n3) Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about functions that either return a value, or fail somewhere along the way. We can model these as functions of type A → Option\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, where Option\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; is a type that contains either a value of type B, or a special value None. There is a natural way to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → Option\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, and another function has type B → Option\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → Option\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;. The \u0026ldquo;composition\u0026rdquo; works just like regular function composition, except if the first function returns None, then it gets passed along and the second function doesn\u0026rsquo;t get called. This way you can have a \u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo; in your code, and check for None only at the end.\n4) Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about functions that call a remote machine asynchronously. We can model these as functions of type A → Promise\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, where Promise\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; is a type that will eventually contain a value of type B, which you can wait for. There is a natural way to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → Promise\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, and another function has type B → Promise\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → Promise\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;. The \u0026ldquo;composition\u0026rdquo; is an asynchronous operation that waits for the first promise to return a value, then calls the second function on that value. This is known in some languages as \u0026ldquo;promise pipelining\u0026rdquo;. It can sometimes make remote calls faster, because you can send both calls to the remote machine in the same request.\n5) Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about functions that do input or output in a pure functional language, like Haskell. We can define IO\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; as the type of opaque \u0026ldquo;IO instructions\u0026rdquo; that describe how to do some IO and return a value of type A. These \u0026ldquo;instructions\u0026rdquo; might eventually be executed by the runtime, but can also be freely passed around and manipulated before that. For example, to create instructions for reading a String from standard input, we\u0026rsquo;d have a function of type Void → IO\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;, and to create instructions for writing a String to standard output, we\u0026rsquo;d have String → IO\u0026lt;Void\u0026gt;. There is a natural way to \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; two such functions. If one function has type A → IO\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, and another function has type B → IO\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;, then we can \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; them into a new function of type A → IO\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;. The \u0026ldquo;composition\u0026rdquo; works by just doing the IO in sequence. Eventually the whole program returns one huge complicated IO instruction with explicit sequencing inside, which is then passed to the runtime for execution. That\u0026rsquo;s how Haskell works.\nAnother thing to note is that each of the examples above also has a natural \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo; function, such that \u0026ldquo;composing\u0026rdquo; it with any other function F gives you F again. For ordinary function composition, it\u0026rsquo;s the ordinary identity function A → A. For lists, it\u0026rsquo;s the function A → List\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that creates a single-element list. For options, it\u0026rsquo;s the function A → Option\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that takes a value and returns an option containing that value. For promises, it\u0026rsquo;s the function A → Promise\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that takes a value and makes an immediately fulfilled promise out of it. And for IO, it\u0026rsquo;s the function A → IO\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; that doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually do any IO.\nAt this point we could go all mathematical and talk about how \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo; is like number multiplication, and \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo; is like the number 1, and then go off into monoids and categories and functors and other things that are frankly boring to me. So let\u0026rsquo;s not go there! Whew!\nInstead, to stay more on the programming track, let\u0026rsquo;s use a Java-like syntax to define an interface Monad with two methods \u0026ldquo;identity\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;compose\u0026rdquo;. The five examples above will correspond to five different concrete classes that implement that interface, for different choices of the type parameter T.\nThe main complication is that the type parameter T must not be a simple type, like String. Instead it must be itself a generic type, like List, Option or Promise. The reason is that we want to have a single implementation of Monad\u0026lt;Option\u0026gt;, not separate implementations like Monad\u0026lt;Option\u0026lt;Integer\u0026gt;\u0026gt;, Monad\u0026lt;Option\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;\u0026gt; and so on. Java and C# don\u0026rsquo;t support generic types whose parameters are themselves generic types (the technical term is \u0026ldquo;higher-kinded types\u0026rdquo;), but C++ has some support for them, called \u0026ldquo;template template parameters\u0026rdquo;. Some functional languages have higher-kinded types, like Haskell, while others don\u0026rsquo;t have them, like ML.\nAnyway, here\u0026rsquo;s what it would look like in Java, if Java supported such things:\ninterface Monad\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { \u0026lt;A\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;A, T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;\u0026gt; identity(); \u0026lt;A, B, C\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;A, T\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;\u0026gt; compose( Function\u0026lt;A, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt; first, Function\u0026lt;B, T\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;\u0026gt; second ); } class OptionMonad implements Monad\u0026lt;Option\u0026gt; { public \u0026lt;A\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;A, Option\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;\u0026gt; identity() { // Implementation omitted, figure it out  } public \u0026lt;A, B, C\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;A, Option\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;\u0026gt; compose( Function\u0026lt;A, Option\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt; first, Function\u0026lt;B, Option\u0026lt;C\u0026gt;\u0026gt; second ) { // Implementation omitted, do it yourself  } } Defining Monad as an interface allows us to implement some general functionality that will work on all monads. For example, there\u0026rsquo;s a well known function \u0026ldquo;liftM\u0026rdquo; that converts a function of type A → B into a function of type List\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; → List\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, or Promise\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; → Promise\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;, or anything else along these lines. For different monads, liftM will do different useful things, e.g. liftM on lists is just the familiar \u0026ldquo;map\u0026rdquo; function in disguise. The implementation of liftM with lambda expressions would be very short, though a little abstract:\n\u0026lt;T, A, B\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt; liftM( Function\u0026lt;A, B\u0026gt; func, Monad\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; monad ) { return (T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; ta) -\u0026gt; monad.compose( () -\u0026gt; ta, (A a) -\u0026gt; monad.identity().apply(func.apply(a)) ).apply(void); } Or if you don\u0026rsquo;t like lambda expressions, here\u0026rsquo;s a version without them:\n\u0026lt;T, A, B\u0026gt; Function\u0026lt;T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt; liftM( Function\u0026lt;A, B\u0026gt; func, Monad\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; monad ) { return new Function\u0026lt;T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt;() { public T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; apply (T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; ta) { return monad.compose( new Function\u0026lt;Void, T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt;\u0026gt;() { public T\u0026lt;A\u0026gt; apply() { return ta; } }, new Function\u0026lt;A, T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt;\u0026gt;() { public T\u0026lt;B\u0026gt; apply(A a) { return monad.identity().apply(func.apply(a)); } } ).apply(void); } } } Monads first became popular as a nice way to deal with IO instructions in a pure language, treating them as first-class values that can be passed around, like in my example 5. Imperative languages don\u0026rsquo;t need monads for IO, but they often face a similar problem of \u0026ldquo;option chaining\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;error chaining\u0026rdquo;, like in my example 3. For example, the option types in Rust or Swift would benefit from having a \u0026ldquo;happy path\u0026rdquo; through the code and a centralized place to handle errors, which is exactly the thing that monads would give you.\nSome people think that monads are about side effects, like some sort of escape hatch for Haskell. That\u0026rsquo;s wrong, because you could always do IO without monads, and in fact the first version of Haskell didn\u0026rsquo;t use them. In any case, only two of my five examples involve side effects. Monads are more like a design pattern for composing functions, which shows up in many places. I think the jury is still out on whether imperative/OO languages need to use monads explicitly, but it might be useful to notice them when they appear in your code implicitly.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  "},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/ruby-enumerable/","title":"A Deeper Look at Ruby&#39;s Enumerable","tags":[],"description":"Ruby’s Enumerable module gives you a way of iterating over collections in a lazy manner, loading only what you need, when you need it.

I use these methods when I need to determine the \u0026lsquo;distance or difference\u0026rsquo; in a set of numbers or objects. each_cons simply gives us a \u0026lsquo;sliding\u0026rsquo; window of our list so we can compare multiple items in our list.\nnumbers = [1,3,5,8,10,54,99] cards = [5,3,4,6,2] # get only the values where the distance is greater than 10 numbers.each_cons(2).select {|a,b| b-a\u0026gt;10 } #=\u0026gt; [[10, 54], [54, 99]] # determine if the hand is a straight cards.sort.each_cons(5).all? do |series| (series.first..series.last).to_a == series end #=\u0026gt; true Our first example shows how to get the elements in the numbers list that are over 10 units in difference. I do this by using each_cons to give me a sliding window of 2 elements at a time. This give me:\nAt each step on the way I check b-a and see if that is greater than 10. If so, the select will return those groups of elements.\nThe second example simply sorts a set of \u0026lsquo;cards\u0026rsquo; and then looking at all 5 cards through each_cons and comparing the scores to see if they are in order and in sequence (a+1==b).\nLet’s play off this example a bit more, this time with dice. If we have to implement small and large straights, we have a similar problem, with a similar solution:\nFor the small straight we get 2 windows, becuase there are 5 values in the list and we are calling each_cons(4). Therefore we want a postfix of any? because either of the windows can be a run of 4.\nIn the second example we use all? to be more explicit, yet any? would have worked as well, because in the large straight, we only have one sliding window, 2,3,4,5,6.\nany? all? none? These have to be a few of my favorite methods in enumerable.\nGiven no args, they take a list of bool values and returns a bool. So [true, true, false].all? #=\u0026gt; false.\nKinda useful, but not really. If we pass it a block of code however.. now we can do something useful. Consider this example:\n.any? and .none? do what you probably think. Where .all? only returns true if ALL the conditions and elements match up, .any? returns true if ANY of them match, and .none? returns true if there were NO matches.\nWeird things like look-ahead? Say you have a file to read in line by line. You need to compare the current line to the next line to look for duplicates. each_cons(2) to the rescue!\nThis will tell us of the current line and the following line are the same.\n More uses for each_cons averages distances smoothing plots graphing geometry     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  "},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/rest-api-in-clojure/","title":"A REST API in Clojure","tags":[],"description":"A newbie friendly introduction to REST API in Clojure.

Initially only the JVM, in the meantime it is also available for JavaScript. Essentially, you can write Clojure and either execute it as Java program or JavaScript program, of course each flavor has its unique features as well.\nClojure is a Lisp, thus the syntax may be foreign, but it is really, really easy since there are very few syntactic variations. The language “Lisp” is very lean and usually easily learned.\nIn this post, we’re going to create a complete REST application from scratch. There are already some (very) good tutorials available, but some are not quite up to date (see Heroku’s Devcenter or Mark McGranaghan for good ones).

It maps all GET requests to / without parameters to \u0026ldquo;Hello World\u0026rdquo;. The (def app (handler/site app-routes)) part configures our application (registering the routes).\nOur first step is to update the configuration. We’re going to work with JSON, so let’s include some Ring middlewares to setup response headers (wrap-json-response) and parse request bodies (wrap-json-body) for us. A middleware is just a wrapper around a handler, thus it can pre- and post-process the whole request/response cycle.\n(def app (-\u0026gt; (handler/api app-routes) (middleware/wrap-json-body) (middleware/wrap-json-response))) We switched also from the handler/site template to handler/api which is more appropriate for REST APIs (documentation).\nNext let’s define the routes for our application:\n(defroutes app-routes (context \u0026#34;/documents\u0026#34; [] (defroutes documents-routes (GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [] (get-all-documents)) (POST \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; {body :body} (create-new-document body)) (context \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; [id] (defroutes document-routes (GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [] (get-document id)) (PUT \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; {body :body} (update-document id body)) (DELETE \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; [] (delete-document id)))))) (route/not-found \u0026#34;Not Found\u0026#34;)) We define GET and POST for the context \u0026ldquo;/documents, and GET, PUT, DELETE for the context \u0026ldquo;:id\u0026rdquo; on top of that. :id is a placeholder and can then be injected into our parameter vector. The POST and PUT request have a special parameter body for the parsed body (this parameter is provided by the wrap-json-body middleware. For more on routes, take a look at Compojure’s documentation.\nBefore we define the functions to carry out the requests, let’s fix the imports and open a pool of database connections to work with.\nThe namespace declaration is used to define which namespaces shall be made available by Clojure.\n(ns clojure-rest.handler (:import com.mchange.v2.c3p0.ComboPooledDataSource) (:use compojure.core) (:use cheshire.core) (:use ring.util.response) (:require [compojure.handler :as handler] [ring.middleware.json :as middleware] [clojure.java.jdbc :as sql] [compojure.route :as route])) We import C3P0’s ComboPooledDataSource, a plain Java class. Next, we fetch the functions defined in compojure.core, cheshire.core, and ring.util.response into our namespace, they can be used without qualifying. Finally we require some more libraries, this time with a qualifier to prevent name clashes or to support nicer separation. I’m not sure when to make the cut between :use and :require yet, so the cut is abitrary.\n(def db-config {:classname \u0026#34;org.h2.Driver\u0026#34; :subprotocol \u0026#34;h2\u0026#34; :subname \u0026#34;mem:documents\u0026#34; :user \u0026#34;\u0026#34; :password \u0026#34;\u0026#34;}) Note, we use a in-memory database. If you’d like to keep your database between restarts, you could use :subname \u0026quot;/tmp/documents\u0026quot; for example.\nNext we open a pool of connections.

We create a table documents with a :id, :title, and :text column. Note that the database column is called id, not :id.\nThe only thing missing are the functions to actually perform the actions requested by our clients.\nTo return a single document with a given id, we could come up with this:\n(defn get-document [id] (sql/with-connection (db-connection) (sql/with-query-results results [\u0026#34;select * from documents where id = ?\u0026#34; id] (cond (empty? results) {:status 404} :else (response (first results)))))) It reads like this: when called with an id, open a database connection, perform select * from documents where id = ? with the given id as parameter. If the result is empty, return 404, otherwise return the first (and only) document as response.\nThe response call will convert the document into JSON, this functionality is provided by wrap-json-response, which also sets the correct Content-Type etc.\nAnother nice one is the creation of new documents:\n(defn uuid [] (str (java.util.UUID/randomUUID))) (defn create-new-document [doc] (let [id (uuid)] (sql/with-connection (db-connection) (let [document (assoc doc \u0026#34;id\u0026#34; id)] (sql/insert-record :documents document))) (get-document id))) Here we use Java’s UUID generator (without import, hence the full package name) to generate a new id for each document created.

Both the first and second are a peculiar way of documenting the code and help to limit (decouple) the interaction of individual abstractions in the program (classes).\nPython is a very flexible language. One facet of this flexibility is the possibilities provided by metaprogramming. And although abstract classes and interfaces are not represented in the core of the language, the former were implemented in the standard abc module, and the latter in the Zope project (the zope.interfaces module).\nIt makes no sense to use both at the same time, and therefore each programmer must determine for himself which tool to use when designing applications.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  Abstract base classes (abc) Starting from version 2.6 of the language, the abc module is included in the standard library, which adds abstract base classes (hereinafter ABC) to the language.\nABC allows you to define a class, indicating which methods or properties must be overridden in inherited classes:\nfrom abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod, abstractproperty class Movable(): __metaclass __ = ABCMeta @abstractmethod def move(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Move object\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; @abstractproperty def speed(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Object speed\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Thus, if we want to use an object with the ability to move and a certain speed in the code, then we should use the Movable class as one of the base classes.\nThe presence of the necessary methods and attributes of the object is now guaranteed by the presence of abstractmethod and abstractproperty.\nclass Car(Movable): def __init__: self.speed = 10 self.x = 0 def move(self): self.c += self.speed def speed(self): return self.speed assert issubclass (Car, Movable) assert ininstance (Car(), Movable) It can be seen that the concept of ABC fits well into the class inheritance hierarchy, it is easy to use them, and the implementation, if you look into the source code of the abc module, is very simple. Abstract classes are used in the standard collections and number modules, defining the methods of custom inherited classes necessary for definition.\nDetails and considerations for using ABC can be found in PEP-3119.\nInterfaces (zope.interfaces) The Zope Toolkit (ZTK) is a set of libraries intended for reuse by projects to develop web applications or web frameworks. It is developed by the contributors of the Zope Foundation. The zope framework has evolved into a set of almost independent components. The glue that holds the components together is the interfaces and the adapters based on them.\nThe zope.interfaces module is the result of this work.\nIn the simplest case, using interfaces is similar to ABC:\nimport zope.interface class IVehicle(zope.interface.Interface): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Any moving thing\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; speed = zope.interface.Attribute(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Movement speed\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) def move(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Make a single step\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; class Car(object): zope.interface.implements (IVehicle) def __init__: self.speed = 1 self.location = 1 def move (self): self.location = self.speed * 1 print(\u0026#34;moved!\u0026#34;) assert IVehicle.implementedBy (Car) assert IVehicle.providedBy (Car ()) The interface declaratively shows what attributes and methods the object should have. Moreover, the class implements the interface, and the object of the class provides. You should pay attention to the difference between these concepts!\n\u0026ldquo;Implementing\u0026rdquo; an interface means that only the \u0026ldquo;produced\u0026rdquo; entity will have the required properties; and \u0026ldquo;providing\u0026rdquo; an interface speaks of the specific capabilities of the entity being evaluated. Accordingly, in Python, classes, by the way, can both implement and provide an interface.\nIn fact, the implementation declaration (IVehicle) is a convention; just a promise that a given class and its objects behave that way. No real checks will be made.\nclass IVehicle (zope.interface.Interface): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Any moving thing\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; speed = zope.interface.Attribute(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Movement speed\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) def move(): \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Make a single step\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; class Car(object): zope.interface.implements(IVehicle) assert IVehicle.implementedBy(Car) assert IVehicle.providedBy(Car()) The component architecture of Zope includes another important concept - adapters. Generally speaking, this is a simple design pattern that corrects one class for use somewhere where a different set of methods and attributes is required.\nAdapters Consider a simple an example from the Comprehensive Guide to Zope Component Architecture.\nSuppose there are a couple of classes, Guest and Desk. Let\u0026rsquo;s define interfaces to them, plus a class that implements the Guest interface:\nimport zope.interface from zope.interface import implements from zope.component import adapts, getGlobalSiteManager class IDesk(zope.interface.Interface): def register(): \u0026#34;Register a person\u0026#34; class IGuest(zope.interface.Interface): name = zope.interface.Attribute (\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Person`s name\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) class Guest (object): implements(IGuest) def __init __ (self, name): self.name = name The adapter must account for the anonymous guest by registering in the list of names:\nclass GuestToDeskAdapter (object): adapts(IGuest) implements(IDesk) def __init __ (self, guest): self.guest = guest def register (self): guest_name_db.append (self.guest.name) There is a registry that keeps track of adapters by interface. Thanks to it, you can get an adapter by passing an adaptable object to the call of the interface class. If the adapter is not registered, the second argument to the interface will be returned:\nguest = Guest (\u0026#34;Ivan\u0026#34;) adapter = IDesk (guest, alternate = None) print adapter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; None found gsm = getGlobalSiteManager () gsm.registerAdapter (GuestToDeskAdapter) adapter = IDesk (guest, alternate = \u0026#34;None found\u0026#34;) print adapter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; __ main __. GuestToDeskAdapter object at 0xb7beb64c\u0026gt; This infrastructure is useful for splitting code into components and linking them together.\nOne of the most striking examples of using this approach besides Zope itself is the Twisted network framework, where a fair amount of the architecture relies on zope.interfaces interfaces.\nConclusion Upon closer inspection, it turns out that interfaces and abstract base classes are two different things.\nAbstract classes basically hardcode the required front-end part. Checking an object against the interface of an abstract class is checked using the built-in isinstance function; class - issubclass. An abstract base class should be included in the hierarchy as a base class or mixin.\nThe downside is the semantics of checks issubclass, isinstance, which intersect with ordinary classes (their inheritance hierarchy). No additional abstractions are built on the ABC.\nInterfaces are a declarative entity, they do not set any boundaries; simply asserts that the class implements and its object provides the interface. Semantically, the statements implementedBy, providedBy are more correct. On such a simple basis, it is convenient to build a component architecture using adapters and other derived entities, which is what the large Zope and Twisted frameworks do.\nIt should be understood that the use of both tools makes sense only when building and using relatively large OOP systems - frameworks and libraries, in small programs they can only confuse and complicate the code with unnecessary abstractions.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  "},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/deep-learning-cardiovascular-imaging/","title":"How Deep Learning Helped Reducing Variability in Cardiovascular Imaging","tags":[],"description":"New software based on deep learning algorithms automatically and accurately calculates LVEF","content":" Bay Labs, a San Francisco-based medical technology company which focuses on using artificial intelligence to improve cardiovascular imaging, has released a new software EchoMD AutoEF. It is being claimed that this software will help to reduce the variability in cardiovascular imaging.\nThe software uses deep learning techniques to accurately calculate the left ventricular ejection fraction.\nWhat is Ejection Fraction? During each pumping cycle of our heart, it contracts and relaxes. When it contracts it passes the blood to ventricles. Ventricles are basically the pumping chambers. Ejection Fraction is the amount of blood withdrawn from the heart when it contracts. Medical professionals use EF to identify the health of a heart. They generally measure the EF from left ventricle because it is the main pumping chamber of the heart which passes the oxygenated blood through the ascending (upward) aorta to the rest of the body.\nMeasuring EF There are various methods available to measure LVEF, out of which Simpson’s biplane method is used widely. This method has about 9.2% average variability. The EchoMD AutoEF software by Bay Labs has an average variability of 8.2%. Moreover, EchoMD AutoEF doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any user intervention, it\u0026rsquo;s fully automatic. It calculates LVEF from complete echocardiographic patient studies, automatically.\nHow Deep Learning Helped? At present Human intervention is required to calculate LVEF. Medical professionals have to go through the recorded clips. They watch them carefully and pick the best ones then they manipulate them for quantification. This is a very time consuming and prone-to-error process (as it is done by humans). The deep learning algorithms helped in this case by totally eliminating the need to do all of the above manually. The training set included 4,000,000 images from about 9,000 patients.\nQuoting Richard Bae, who is the Director of the Echocardiography Laboratory at the Minneapolis Heart Institute:\n \u0026ldquo;Historically there have been challenges with variability and reproducibility in reporting of the ejection fraction, especially when the EF is not normal; our study showed that the EchoMD AutoEF algorithms can aid interpretation enormously and have less variability than cardiologists reported in the literature.”\n\u0026ldquo;By supporting fast, efficient and accurate AI-assisted echocardiogram analysis, the algorithms can allow physicians to focus on putting results into the context for the patient - guiding prognosis and course of management.”\n This is a great innovation in the medical field. It will help cardiologists in better decision making.\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given 510(k) clearance to this product. Which means that the device is safe and effective in automatically selecting clips and calculating LVEF.\n "},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/google-engineers-boycott-security-tool-military/","title":"Google Engineers Boycott Against Security Tool for Military","tags":[],"description":"A group of 9 cloud engineers at Google has refused to work on air-gap due to which Google may lose a deal worth $10 billion.","content":" A group of 9 cloud engineers at Google has refused to work on a project called air-gap due to which Google may lose a deal worth $10 billion. Google needs air-gap if it has to do some sensitive work with government agencies involving sensitive data (obviously military implications there). So this group of 9 basically just said they weren\u0026rsquo;t gonna do it. About 10-12 employees have resigned so far as part of this work strike. Google spends a lot of time making sure their top talent is happy so that they stick around and don\u0026rsquo;t go to other companies, so Google just stood down on this one. Urs Hölzle, the senior VP of technical infrastructure at Google said that the feature would be postponed.\nOn the one hand this is good as it shows that employees get ample space to air grievances, but on the other hand, the shareholders will get angry as it hampers Google\u0026rsquo;s ability to compete. In order to get government contracts especially those which involves sensitive data and military require some certifications, which Google\u0026rsquo;s competitors like Microsoft and Amazon have but Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t. This air-gap feature was supposed to help Google with that but it seems it\u0026rsquo;ll be abandoned.\nWhat is air-gap? Microsoft and Amazon have set-up a service called Government Cloud (Azure Government and AWS GovCloud) where the sensitive government information can be stored. An important feature of this service is air-gap. It is a security measure which ensures that a secured computer network is physically isolated from unsecured networks. Therefore, instead of storing data from multiple sources in a single server/system you store it in a separate isolated hardware. This is helpful for the government if they want to know where their data reside (physically) so that they can wipe it immediately.\nAlthough the feature is not that difficult to implement, Google can form a new team to work on it but looking at the fate of Project Maven which got similar boycott, it\u0026rsquo;d be difficult for Google.\nBesides, U.S. Congress is accusing Google over the partnership with Huawei, a Chinese manufacturer which makes Android phones. They said  You were not with the Pentagon on an AI project but you\u0026rsquo;ll work with the Chinese handset manufacturer.\n That is a very difficult situation for Google and I think they are right now working on how to handle this.\nSource: Bloomberg\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/nodejs-google-app-engine/","title":"How to deploy Node.js app on Google App Engine","tags":[],"description":"Learn how to deploy your Node.js app on the Google App Engine.","content":" Google App Engine is a part of the Google Cloud Suite which provides a cloud platform for developers where they can develop and host their apps.

It is a major release in which Angular team has synchronized many of the important framework packages to make most out of cross compatibility. All the major framework packages like @angular/core, @angular/compiler, @angular/common etc., are reworked and released as version 6.0.0. Below is the list of major changes in Angular 6, let\u0026rsquo;s explore them one by one.\nAngular 6 Features:  New CLI commands  ng update ng add  Referencing providers Angular Elements Angular Material + CDK Components  Tree Badge Bottom-Sheet Overlay  Starter Components  Dashboard Side-Nav Datatable  Library Support CLI Workspaces RxJS v6 Long Term Support  ng update A new command is introduced in Angular CLI which analyzes package.json and recommends any updates (if needed) on the installed packages.\nThis is going to make your life easy as now you don\u0026rsquo;t have to manually synchronize your dependencies. This will work using Schematics, a workflow tool which is based on Tree data structure. For example a tree has base, scripts following schematics will also have a base and that base will be the root structure. Any modification has first have to pass from staging area to make its way to the root. If any of the dependency provide a schematic then it can automatically update your code whenever there are major changes.\nSo now if you run ng update @angular/common it will update the package and run any schematic available for this package.\n   (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});  To get more details on ng update usage, refer the official specification.\nng add This is another CLI command added in Angular 6. This will be helpful in adding new packages to your project. It downloads the packages (with their dependencies) using the package manager and installs them with the help of Schematics.\nng add @angular/material // Install and configure Angular Material ng add @ng-bootstrap/schematics // Add ng-bootstrap in your application  This area will flourish with increase in packages supporting ng add. Refer Material\u0026rsquo;s ng-add schematic to get an idea on how to write one for your application.\nReferencing Providers Before this update we used to reference services from module but with Angular 6 we will reference module from service.\nAngular Elements @angular/elements creates a custom element which acts as a bridge between Angular component interface and change detection functionality to the built-in DOM API. You can bootstrap Angular components with your application and they will be registered as Angular Elements. One of the benefits that you get from this is that it\u0026rsquo;ll dynamically insert HTML code holding Angular components after your application is compiled.\nAngular Material + CDK Components Below are some new components that have been added in Angular 6.\n Tree: It is based on datatable component and is best suited for representing hierarchical data. CDK contains the core tree directive (cdk-tree) whereas mat-tree comes with Material design style. See this presentation from ng conf 2018 to get more details on Material Trees.   Badge: This component can be used to display a small piece of information such as notification count on notification drawer, unread emails count over the email icon etc.   Bottom-Sheet: This component is mobile-centric which can be used to present a list of options for a particular action. It appears from the bottom of the viewport (with slide-up animation).   Overlay: @angular/cdk/overlay has been updated with a new positioning logic which helps in creating intelligent pop-ups that remain on the screen in all situations.   Starter Components With Angular 6 you get 3 new starter components after running ng add @angular/material. With this update in place, it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to create simple UI.\n Create a dashboard\nng generate @angular/material:material-dashboard --name=test-dashboard    Create side navigation\nng generate @angular/material:material-nav --name=test-nav    Create a datatable\nng generate @angular/material:material-table --name=test-table   Library Support Library support has been added in 6.0.0. You can easily create a library using below command. See details.\nng generate library \u0026lt;name\u0026gt;  CLI Workspaces CLI can now support workspaces with multiple projects. angular-cli.json has been renamed to angular.json. Each workspace can have multiple projects, each project can have targets and each target can have a configuration.\nRxJS v6 Angular 6 supports RxJS v6. RxJS v6 ensures that only those modules are bundled in production that are being used by your application. If you are moving from the previous version to Angular 6 then you have to change import statements and operator usage to make your application work. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to change then you can use this new package rxjs-compat which provides backward compatibility.\nLong Term Support Angular team announced to provide long-term support for all major releases starting from version 4. LTS will include 6 months of active development + 12 months of security patches and critical bug fixes.\nOther Changes:  \u0026lt;template\u0026gt; tag has been removed so now you have to use \u0026lt;ng-template\u0026gt; instead. - @angular/http is deprecated, @angular/common/http is the recommended alternative.

But what is the difference between them? When should you use one over another, let\u0026rsquo;s find out.\nThe official documentation describes them as:\n list.append(x): Add an item to the end of the list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].\n list.extend(L): Extend the list by appending all the items in the given list; equivalent to a[len(a):] = L.\n  Notice the bold words in the definition. append adds an item and extend appends all the items of the given list.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example:\nappend a list to another list in Python some_list = [\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5] another_list = [\u0026#39;new data\u0026#39;, 12] some_list.append(another_list) print some_list Output:\n[\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5, [\u0026#39;new data\u0026#39;, 12]] As you can see, the append method took an item i.e. the object of another list and added it to some_list as it is.\nextend a list with another list in Python some_list = [\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5] another_list = [\u0026#39;new data\u0026#39;, 12] some_list.extend(another_list) print some_list Output:\n[\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5, \u0026#39;new data\u0026#39;, 12] In case of extend you can see that all the items from another_list were appended to some_list one by one. So you can say extend method concatenates one list with another list.\nQuiz Q: What will be the output of below code:\nsome_list = [\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5] data = \u0026#39;hello\u0026#39; some_list.extend(data) print some_list A: Output is\n[\u0026#39;string\u0026#39;, 1, \u0026#39;another string\u0026#39;, 6.5, \u0026#39;h\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;e\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;o\u0026#39;] Explanation: If you notice carefully, data is a string and strings in Python are iterable. Therefore the extend method iterated over all characters in the string one by one and appended them to the list.\nSo based on above we can say that below 2 code snippets are equivalent:\nfor data in iterator: some_list.append(data)some_list.extend(iterator)"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/print-same-line-python/","title":"How to print on same line with print in Python","tags":["Python"],"description":"Use a comma at the end of print function to write the data on same line","content":" In Python, when you use the print function, it prints a new line at the end.\nFor example:\nprint \u0026#34;This is some line.\u0026#34; print \u0026#34;This is another line.\u0026#34; Output:\nThis is some line.

History, Popularity and Applications.","content":" Introduction Bjarne Stroustrup, a C and Simula67 enthusiast, thought of combining the best of both the languages, and subsequently, C++ emanated at AT\u0026amp;T Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, USA, in the early 1980’s. Stroustrup’s C with Classes became C++ in 1983, the ‘++’ denoting the Increment Operator in C. The programming language can run on a number of platforms like Windows, Mac OS and numerous versions of UNIX. The most recent version of C++ programming language is C++ 17, revised by ISO/IEC 14882 standard.\nPopularity of C++ The TIOBE Index indicates that C and C++ are till date among the most used languages among programmers. Being a combination of both high-level and low-level language, C++ is regarded as a \u0026ldquo;middle-level\u0026rdquo; language. The language has evolved with time, and as of now, possesses facilities for low-level memory manipulation in addition to object-oriented, generic and functional features. It supports Object Oriented Programming in its entirety including the four pillars of object-oriented development, namely\n Encapsulation Data Hiding Inheritance Polymorphism  Applications of C++  Operating Systems: Being a strongly typed language in addition to being fast, C++ becomes a perfect choice when it comes to writing operating systems. C being analogous to assembly language, further aids in writing low-level operating system modules. Hence, it is no surprise that most of the softwares of Microsoft are developed using C++, also Mac OSX has some of its parts written in C++. Browsers: The fast performance of C++ makes it an ideal choice for the rendering engines of various browsers. Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Apple Safari are developed using C++. Libraries: C++ is used as the backend programming language of many high-level libraries, for example, Tensorflow; one of the most significantly used Machine Learning Libraries. Databases: C++ is used in writing Database Management Softwares. Two of the most popular Databases, MySQL and PostgreSQL are written in C and C++. GUI based Applications: \u0026ldquo;Speed\u0026rdquo; is what matters in graphics applications because it helps the developers in expanding their target audience. Applications which have high-end graphical processing like most of the applications of the Adobe Creative Cloud viz. Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. are developed by using C++. Cloud Systems: The compatibility of C++ with a lot of machines along with its affinity with the hardware makes it a perfect choice for cloud storage and distributed systems. Load tolerance and high concurrency is provided by the multithreading libraries in C++ which becomes a huge advantage.  In addition to the above mentioned applications, C++ is also majorly used in Embedded Systems, Compilers and Banking Applications besides a multitude of other uses.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/r/introduction/","title":"Introduction","tags":["R"],"description":"A gentle introduction to R programming language.","content":" What is R? R is a programming language that is gaining its importance in software development, machine learning and data science. R is free and open source software under GNU General public license and pre-compiled binary versions and libraries are also provided for various operating systems like MAC, Linux and Windows. R provides a software environment for Statistical Modeling of data, Exploratory Data Analysis, Graphics Representation and Reproducible Researches.\nEvolution of R R is considered to be the dialect of S language. S language was founded in 1976 by John Chambers and later on at Bell Laboratories as an Internal Statistical Analysis Environment with its implementation of Fortran Libraries. Earlier versions of the language failed in containing various useful functions for Statistical Modeling which led to the development of R language. R Language was founded in 1991 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and is currently developed by R Development Core Team.\nFeatures of R  R is a well developed, simple and most interactive programming language which includes conditional and looping statements, user defined functions and libraries. R contains a variety of atomic data types like Numeric, Characters, Logical, Integer and Complex and thereby providing integrated and coherent collection of tools for data analysis. R provides a suite of operators for manipulations of array, data frames, vectors, matrices, strings and lists. Functionality is divided into various modular packages available in R. Graphics capabilities are more sophisticated and contain more Stat Packages for Base plotting system, Lattice systems and ggplots systems. R has its very largely active and vibrant user community.  Overview of its applications R has its majority of applications in the field of data science and machine learning algorithms. Some of its applications include:\n Descriptive Analysis Exploratory Data Analysis Statistical Inferences Predictive Modeling Causal and Random Analysis Mechanistic Analysis and Reproducible Research  As a conclusion, R is proving to be world’s most widely used Statistical Programming Language.

They can be classified into broadly two types.\n1. Linear Data Structures Data structures in which data is stored in the sequential arrangement are called linear data structures. For example arrays, linked lists, queues etc. Please note that this does not imply storing data in consecutive locations. Data can be stored anywhere in the memory, though the linked list is a linear data structure, it does not store data in contiguous memory locations. By linear data structures, we mean that when we traverse the data structure then we will always get the values in a sequence.\n2. Non-linear Data Structures Non-linear data structure does not follow any sequence for storing data. Here data is stored hierarchically in multiple levels. Here computer memory is used more efficiently than linear data structures. E.g. trees, graphs\nTrees Tree is a hierarchical data structure. In tree data structure, data is stored in the form of nodes. Each node can be connected to zero or multiple nodes through edges. In this data structure, the arrangement of data resembles an inverted tree. It consists of one root node, branches and leaves. The root node is the node in the topmost layer while leaves are the nodes in the bottommost layer. Parent nodes are connected to their children through edges. Any node of a tree can have zero children or multiple children. E.g. in a binary tree any node can have minimum zero and at most two children. A N-ary tree can have minimum zero and at most n children.\nBinary Tree Any node of a binary tree can have 0, 1 or at most 2 children. Every node in a binary tree has a parent node except the root node. Every node can have 0, 1 or 2 children except the leaf nodes which will have 0 children. In a binary tree, every node contains data and pointers to the left and right child nodes respectively.\nBasic terminologies  Root: node at the topmost level of the tree Leaf node: node at the bottommost level of the tree Edge: a line connecting parent node to the child node Parent node: node connected to the given node in the level above Child node: node connected to the given node in the level below Grandparent: parent of the parent node is called a grandparent Siblings: nodes having the same parent node Height: total no. of levels between the root node and the leaf in the bottommost level Depth: length of the path from the root to a particular node Subtree: any node and all its descendants form a subtree of the given tree  Structure of a binary tree node struct tree { int data; struct tree *left; struct tree *right; } Basic Tree Functions  Insert: insert a new node Search: search a node with the given key Delete: delete a node Preorder traversing: Access the root, then traverse the left subtree and later traverse the right subtree Inorder traversing: Traverse left subtree then access root and later traverse right subtree Postorder traversing: Traverse left subtree, then traverse right subtree and visit the root in the end  Binary Search Tree (BST) These are special types of binary trees where the value of every node in the left subtree is less than the value of the root node as well as the value of every node in the right subtree is greater than the value of the root node. Binary search trees are very efficient for performing search operations. Operations like search, insertion and deletion can be done in trees in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree. AVL tree is a special type of binary search tree which maintains the height of a tree equal to log(n). Hence search complexity in case of AVL tree is always log(n).\nThe below image shows an example of a BST.\n"},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/pandas-cookbook/chapter4/","title":"Chapter 4 - Groupby and Aggregate","tags":[],"description":"Find out on which weekday people bike the most with groupby and aggregate","content":" %matplotlib inline import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt pd.set_option(\u0026#39;display.mpl_style\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;default\u0026#39;) # Make the graphs a bit prettier plt.rcParams[\u0026#39;figure.figsize\u0026#39;] = (15, 5) plt.rcParams[\u0026#39;font.family\u0026#39;] = \u0026#39;sans-serif\u0026#39; # This is necessary to show lots of columns in pandas 0.12.  # Not necessary in pandas 0.13. pd.set_option(\u0026#39;display.width\u0026#39;, 5000) pd.set_option(\u0026#39;display.max_columns\u0026#39;, 60) Okay!

I found out that 0 was Monday by checking on a calendar.\nNow that we know how to get the weekday, we can add it as a column in our dataframe like this:\nberri_bikes.loc[:,\u0026#39;weekday\u0026#39;] = berri_bikes.index.weekday berri_bikes[:5] Output:\n  Berri 1 weekday   Date       2012-01-01  35  6   2012-01-02  83  0   2012-01-03  135  1   2012-01-04  144  2   2012-01-05  197  3      4.2 Adding up the cyclists by weekday This turns out to be really easy! Dataframes have a .groupby() method that is similar to SQL groupby, if you\u0026rsquo;re familiar with that. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to explain more about it right now \u0026ndash; if you want to to know more, the documentation is really good.\nIn this case, berri_bikes.groupby('weekday').aggregate(sum) means\n \u0026ldquo;Group the rows by weekday and then add up all the values with the same weekday.\u0026rdquo;\n weekday_counts = berri_bikes.groupby(\u0026#39;weekday\u0026#39;).aggregate(sum) weekday_counts Output:\n  Berri 1   weekday      0  134298   1  135305   2  152972   3  160131   4  141771   5  101578   6  99310      It\u0026rsquo;s hard to remember what 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 mean, so we can fix it up and graph it:\nweekday_counts.index = [\u0026#39;Monday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Tuesday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Wednesday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Thursday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Friday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Saturday\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Sunday\u0026#39;] weekday_counts Output:\n  Berri 1     Monday  134298   Tuesday  135305   Wednesday  152972   Thursday  160131   Friday  141771   Saturday  101578   Sunday  99310      weekday_counts.plot(kind=\u0026#39;bar\u0026#39;) Output:\n  So it looks like Montrealers are commuter cyclists \u0026ndash; they bike much more during the week. Neat!\n4.3 Putting it together Let\u0026rsquo;s put all that together, to prove how easy it is. 6 lines of magical pandas!

So, learning Python would make you a proficient software developer who is job-ready and can apply his/her skills to solve real-world problems.\nAnother great reason for learning Python is it’s large Open Source community. If you run into any error then you will surely find other people on Github or Stack Overflow with same errors and also one’s those who have already solved that error and posted a possible fix to that.\nFeatures  Dynamically typed: Unlike Java or C++ we don’t have to mention about the data type when assigning variables, Python has the ability to figure that out on its own.

Easy to Read Huge range of Libraries and modules supported.  Applications  Data Science Web Development Generic Operating System Services Image Processing Scientific Computing  "},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/java/generics/","title":"Generics in Java","tags":["Java"],"description":"In simple words, generic methods (or classes) are those methods that are written with single method declaration and can be called or accessed with arguments of different type.","content":" Generics in Java is the facility which is provided to the user to make a single method or single class that can be compatible with any data type like a single method can operate on integer type or string type or even object type. If you are familiar with template in C++, then you can consider generics as a template in Java. In simple words, generic methods(or classes) are those methods that are written with single method declaration and can be called or accessed with arguments of different type.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s understand this with the help of an example. Suppose you have to view an image in your computer using a software. Consider a scenario where a single software can view or edit only single image file format, e.g. software A can view only jpg file, software B can view only png file, software C can view only gif file etc. On the other hand there is only a single software X which can view any type of image files.\nNow if you have the option to choose any one of the software, which one will you choose? It\u0026rsquo;s quite obvious you will choose the software X because having many softwares will be very inefficient and it will consume more memory. In the same way, Generics in Java works. Instead of having different methods and classes for doing the same task, we make only one method or class which will be compatible with any data type as Integer, Double, String, Employee (object type) etc.\nSyntax To create object of generic class or method we follow the below syntax:\nabc obj\u0026lt;Type1,Type2,...,Type n\u0026gt; = new abc\u0026lt;Type1,Type2,...,Type n\u0026gt;()\nHere Type can be replaced with any data type but remember that it cannot have primitive data types like int, double, etc. It should be of object type like Integer, Double, String, Float, Employee etc.\nThere is a general convention for this Type parameter:\n T is used for type. E is used for an element. N is used for numbers. K is used for the key. V is used for the value.  Example public class test { public \u0026lt; E \u0026gt; void showArray(E[] s) { for (E x: s) System.out.println(x); } public static void main(String[] args) { test Obj = new test(); String name[] = new String[] { \u0026#34;Sachin\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Virat\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Dhoni\u0026#34; }; Integer roll[] = { 10, 23, 44 }; Obj.showArray(name); Obj.showArray(roll); } } Output:\nSachin Virat Dhoni 10 23 44 In this example, type parameter \u0026lt;E\u0026gt; gets replaced by the string when called with string array and by integer when called by integer array. The type parameter is placed before the return type of the method.\nWe can have more than one parameter type in a method or class. Example:\npublic class test { Public \u0026lt; E, N \u0026gt; void showArray(E x, N y) { System.out.println(x); System.out.println(y); } Public static void main(String[] args) { test obj = new test(); obj.showArray(\u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;, 43); } } Output:\nJohn Doe 43 Generics in Class Not only methods, but we can also have classes that can be of a generic type. For example-\nPublic class test \u0026lt; T \u0026gt; { T i; Public void add(T i1) { i = i1; } public T get() { return (i); } } public class TestGen { public static void main(String[] args) { test \u0026lt; Integer \u0026gt; m1 = new test \u0026lt; Integer \u0026gt; (); test \u0026lt; String \u0026gt; m2 = new test \u0026lt; String \u0026gt; (); Integer k = new Integer(199); m1.add(k); m2.add(\u0026#34;John Doe\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;m1 = \u0026#34; + m1.get() + \u0026#34; m2 = \u0026#34; + m2.get()); } } OUTPUT:\nm1 = 199 m2 = ohn Doe We used the same class test to print the two different types of data (String and Integer). Here also, we can have multiple parameters.\nWildcards With wildcard, we can further enhance the usage of generics. We use a wildcard when we want to make a method or class that can accept any kind of data or collection or when we want to impose some restrictions or relaxation on a variable. Let’s take an example:\nvoid printCollection(Collection \u0026lt; Object \u0026gt; c) { for (Object e: c) { System.out.println(e); } } The above code will only accept the type Object for functioning and will not accept any other type of collection. That\u0026rsquo;s the point where wildcard comes to play its role. To make the method acceptable for any data collections, we will use the wildcard \u0026lsquo;?\u0026rsquo;.\nvoid printCollection(Collection\u0026lt;?\u0026gt; c) { for (Object e : c) { System.out.println(e); } } Now the above code will run for any type of collections like Integer, Double, Object, etc.\nUpper-bound Wildcards It provides the freedom to the variable by either making it a specific type or subtype of the specific type. In Java, it is declared by using the ? keyword followed by the extend keyword. Extend keyword is used to provide access to the subtypes of the specific type to the methods. Example list\u0026lt;? extends Number\u0026gt; can be used to extend the type Number along with its subtype (Integer, Double etc.) whereas list\u0026lt;Numbers\u0026gt; restrict user with a list of type number only. Observe the below code for better understanding.\nimport java.util.ArrayList; public class UpperBoundWildcard { private static Double add(ArrayList \u0026lt; ? extends Number \u0026gt; num) { double sum = 0.0; for (Number n: num) { sum = sum + n.doubleValue(); } return sum; } public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList \u0026lt; Integer \u0026gt; l1 = new ArrayList \u0026lt; Integer \u0026gt; (); l1.add(10); l1.add(20); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Displaying the sum = \u0026#34; + add(l1)); ArrayList \u0026lt; Double \u0026gt; l2 = new ArrayList \u0026lt; Double \u0026gt; (); l2.add(30.0); l2.add(40.0); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Displaying the sum = \u0026#34; + add(l2)); } } OUTPUT:\nDisplaying the sum = 30.0 Displaying the sum = 70.0 In the above code, a list of integer and list of double is executed without any error.\nUnbounded Wildcards Unbounded wild cards are used when we don\u0026rsquo;t know what type of list will come as input. In that case, we make our method using list\u0026lt;?\u0026gt; which means that list can be of any type. We use it when we want our method independent from parameter type. Example:\nimport java.util.Arrays; import java.util.List; public class UnboundedWildcard { public static void display(List \u0026lt; ? \u0026gt;list) { for (Object o: list) { System.out.println(o); } } public static void main(String[] args) { List \u0026lt; Integer \u0026gt; l1 = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Displaying the Integer values\u0026#34;); display(l1); List \u0026lt; String \u0026gt; l2 = Arrays.asList(\u0026#34;One\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Two\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Three\u0026#34;); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Displaying the String values\u0026#34;); display(l2); } } OUTPUT:\nDisplaying the Integer values 1 2 3 Displaying the String values One Two Three The above code worked well for both types of lists i.e. integer and string. This is the advantage of unbounded wildcard.\nLower-bound Wildcards We use lower bound wildcards when we want to work on a specific type or superclass of that type like integers and its superclass numbers. It is used by declaring wildcard symbol ? followed by the super keyword. Consider the following example:\nimport java.util.Arrays; import java.util.List; public class LowerBoundWildcard { public static void addNumbers(List \u0026lt; ? super Integer \u0026gt; list) { for (Object n: list) { System.out.println(n); } } public static void main(String[] args) { List \u0026lt; Integer \u0026gt; l1 = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Displaying the Integer values\u0026#34;); addNumbers(l1); List \u0026lt; Number \u0026gt; l2 = Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Displaying the Number values\u0026#34;); addNumbers(l2); } }  OUTPUT:\nDisplaying the Integer values 1 2 3 Displaying the Number values 1.0 2.0 3.0 In the above code, we declared the list type be integers but by using the super keyword we made the method acceptable for superclass of integers. That\u0026rsquo;s why we were able to print double values too because superclass of integers i.e. numbers contains double class.\nAdvantage of Generics  Reduced redundancy: It saves the user from typing the same code multiple times. Makes the code more readable and reduces the complex code into simpler code. Type safety: It provides the user the type safety facility i.e. a user can store only a single type of object. For example - a list can be either of integer type or string type {1,2,3} or {\u0026quot;one\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;two\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;three\u0026quot;} but list like {1 ,2,\u0026quot; three\u0026quot;} is not acceptable. Observe the below code for better understanding.\nList list = new Arraylist(); list.add(50); list.add(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); List \u0026lt; Integer \u0026gt; list = new Arraylist \u0026lt; Integer \u0026gt; (); list.add(10); list.add(\u0026#34;10\u0026#34;); //compile time error because type safety not followed Compile time error detection: A user mainly prefer to detect the error at compile time rather than run time because error handling at compile time is far easier than that at run time. And this facility is provided by generics to the user.\n Free from typecasting: While accessing the member of the list, one doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to typecast the object like one used to do before without generics.\nList list =new ArrayList(); list.add(“hello”); String s=(String) list.get(0);//typecasting //After generics, we don’t need typecasting. List\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; list=new ArrayList\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;(); List.add(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); String s=list.get(0);  "},{"uri":"https://tutswiki.com/pandas-cookbook/chapter5/","title":"Chapter 5 - Web scraping with Pandas","tags":[],"description":"Web scraping with Pandas.

The file we\u0026rsquo;re using here is a popularity-contest file I found on my system at /var/log/popularity-contest.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an explanation of how this file works.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to hope that nothing in it is sensitive :)\nimport pandas as pd # Read it, and remove the last row popcon = pd.read_csv(\u0026#39;popularity-contest\u0026#39;, sep=\u0026#39; \u0026#39;, )[:-1] popcon.columns = [\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;package-name\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;mru-program\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;tag\u0026#39;] popcon[:5] The colums are the access time, created time, package name, recently used program, and a tag\nOutput:\n  atime ctime package-name mru-program tag     0  1387295797  1367633260  perl-base  /usr/bin/perl  NaN   1  1387295796  1354370480  login  /bin/su  NaN   2  1387295743  1354341275  libtalloc2  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtalloc.so.2.0.7  NaN   3  1387295743  1387224204  libwbclient0  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwbclient.so.0  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   4  1387295742  1354341253  libselinux1  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1  NaN      The magical part about parsing timestamps in pandas is that numpy datetimes are already stored as Unix timestamps. So all we need to do is tell pandas that these integers are actually datetimes \u0026ndash; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to do any conversion at all.\nWe need to convert these to ints to start:\npopcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;] = popcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;].astype(int) popcon[\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;] = popcon[\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;].astype(int) Every numpy array and pandas series has a dtype \u0026ndash; this is usually int64, float64, or object. Some of the time types available are datetime64[s], datetime64[ms], and datetime64[us]. There are also timedelta types, similarly.\nWe can use the pd.to_datetime function to convert our integer timestamps into datetimes. This is a constant-time operation \u0026ndash; we\u0026rsquo;re not actually changing any of the data, just how pandas thinks about it.\npopcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;] = pd.to_datetime(popcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;], unit=\u0026#39;s\u0026#39;) popcon[\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;] = pd.to_datetime(popcon[\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;], unit=\u0026#39;s\u0026#39;) popcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;].dtype Output:\ndtype(\u0026#39;\u0026lt;M8[ns]\u0026#39;) If we look at the dtype now, it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026lt;M8[ns]. As far as I can tell M8 is secret code for datetime64.\nSo now we can look at our atime and ctime as dates!\npopcon[:5] Output:\n  atime ctime package-name mru-program tag     0 2013-12-17 15:56:37 2013-05-04 02:07:40  perl-base  /usr/bin/perl  NaN   1 2013-12-17 15:56:36 2012-12-01 14:01:20  login  /bin/su  NaN   2 2013-12-17 15:55:43 2012-12-01 05:54:35  libtalloc2  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtalloc.so.2.0.7  NaN   3 2013-12-17 15:55:43 2013-12-16 20:03:24  libwbclient0  /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libwbclient.so.0  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   4 2013-12-17 15:55:42 2012-12-01 05:54:13  libselinux1  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1  NaN      Now suppose we want to look at all packages that aren\u0026rsquo;t libraries.\nFirst, I want to get rid of everything with timestamp 0. Notice how we can just use a string in this comparison, even though it\u0026rsquo;s actually a timestamp on the inside? That is because pandas is amazing.\npopcon = popcon[popcon[\u0026#39;atime\u0026#39;] \u0026gt; \u0026#39;1970-01-01\u0026#39;] Now we can use pandas\u0026rsquo; magical string abilities to just look at rows where the package name doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain \u0026lsquo;lib\u0026rsquo;.\nnonlibraries = popcon[~popcon[\u0026#39;package-name\u0026#39;].str.contains(\u0026#39;lib\u0026#39;)] nonlibraries.sort(\u0026#39;ctime\u0026#39;, ascending=False)[:10] Output:\n  atime ctime package-name mru-program tag     57  2013-12-17 04:55:39 2013-12-17 04:55:42  ddd  /usr/bin/ddd  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   450 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:05:13  nodejs  /usr/bin/npm  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   454 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:05:04  switchboard-plug-keyboard  /usr/lib/plugs/pantheon/keyboard/options.txt  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   445 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:05:04  thunderbird-locale-en  /usr/lib/thunderbird-addons/extensions/langpac...  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   396 2013-12-16 20:08:27 2013-12-16 20:05:03  software-center  /usr/sbin/update-software-center  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   449 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:05:00  samba-common-bin  /usr/bin/net.samba3  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   397 2013-12-16 20:08:25 2013-12-16 20:04:59  postgresql-client-9.1  /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/psql  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   398 2013-12-16 20:08:23 2013-12-16 20:04:58  postgresql-9.1  /usr/lib/postgresql/9.1/bin/postmaster  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   452 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:04:55  php5-dev  /usr/include/php5/main/snprintf.h  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;   440 2013-12-16 20:03:20 2013-12-16 20:04:54  php-pear  /usr/share/php/XML/Util.php  \u0026lt;RECENT-CTIME\u0026gt;      Okay, cool, it says that I I installed ddd recently. And postgresql! I remember installing those things. Neat.\nThe whole message here is that if you have a timestamp in seconds or milliseconds or nanoseconds, then you can just \u0026ldquo;cast\u0026rdquo; it to a datetime64[the-right-thing] and pandas/numpy will take care of the rest.\nWhere from here?
